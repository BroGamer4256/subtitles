2515;AE121_041;This is G2. We're being attacked by the cannons.
2820;AE122_009;And they're fast too! These things are tricky.
993;AE121_061;Fall back!
1185;AE121_040;They're firing!
4832;AE122_004;Don't underestimate the drones. The fact they're only machines makes them even more terrifying weapons.
1669;AE121_043;Beware of those large cannons.
1748;AE122_001;Red colour drones confirmed.
3036;AE121_048;Incoming fire! Get to cover before its too late.
1889;AE121_030;Our attack on the base was ineffective.
5779;AE121_068;If we don't shoot down all of the drones they will cause a lot of damage. Shoot down all drones.
5910;AE121_065;Oh no. If we let those drones chase us the city will suffer heavy casualties.
2531;AE121_056;Run! It's too dangerous here.
1873;AE121_036;I knew it wouldn't be a cakewalk.
2795;AE121_038;I know! But we can't continue the mission anymore.
1306;AE121_050;The drones are coming.
1431;AE121_060;Retreat! Hurry!
2312;AE121_031;The airstrike didn't seem to work either
2859;AE122_008;Crap. It's got too much firepower.
6360;AE121_033;I can't believe they can deploy entire bases. Those aliens certainly came prepared.
2498;AE121_053;The giant cannons are activating.
4496;AE122_003;I shot down 7 drones by myself. I'm going to break my record today.
1098;AE121_051;Drones incoming!
1839;AE121_042;The large cannons are activating.
1625;AE121_046;We can't take it anymore.
2117;AE121_069;There are some drones remaining. Shoot them down.
1990;AE121_045;The artillery fire is too strong.
4022;AE121_054;This is G4. Confirm that the giant cannons have been initiated.
1741;AE122_005;Attack the red colour drones.
1523;AE121_063;Drones are coming again.
2587;AE121_064;Drones! They're hunting us down.
2652;AE121_057;*Scream*
5371;AE121_032;Currently Currently there are 5 alien bases around the world. Each of them was dropped from the sky.
3877;AE121_035;We are here to protect the city. But I didn't expect this sight.
1471;AE121_067;Shoot down the drones.
1035;AE121_062;Fall back! Now!
4621;AE122_002;The drones are in alert mode. When they're hit the drones around them will switch to combat mode.
2499;AE121_037;Our objective is to collect intel.
3896;AE121_066;Don't let those drones spread out. Shoot down the drones as you fall back.
1322;AE122_007;*Scream*
1303;AE121_059;All units retreat.
1889;AE121_055;What the hell is that?
3654;AE121_044;These are plasma cannons. Can't believe they have that kind of technology.
2833;AE121_034;Which means areas surronding the base are suppressed.
6440;AE121_070;They'll be dominating the ground as long the base exists. We've been outplayed.
1474;AE121_039;The cannons are activating.
1881;AE122_006;Make scrap metal out of 'em.
1490;AE121_047;We're being attacked by the base.
2019;AE121_058;We can't continue like this. Retreat.
1972;AE121_049;Drones are dispatched from the base.
1177;AE121_052;Shoot down the drones.
1428;AA003FB;*Scream*
1314;AA003AB;Always be prepated for battle.
2629;AA003Y;Fighting without knowing anything. Can't believe it.

2754;AA004W;I analysed the situation but still couldn't get it.
1700;AA004X;Is there any special allowance.
2505;AA004Y;My friend is dead. I can't believe that.

3866;AA009X;It's easy to be a solider. Just don't dream about being promoted.
1855;AA009Y;Guess I have to cancel my holiday plans.

4043;AA010X;Nothing good about getting promoted. Being on the battlefield is the best.
2219;AA010Y;I plan to go on a trip. Should I cancel it?
3086;AA010Z;Don't fear death. Make death fear you.
4724;AA010ZA;We are looked down upon due to the uniform. All because we have to keep our equipment light.

1527;AE001AA;*Scream*
1899;AE001AB;Yeah!
1432;AE001AC;*Scream*
1426;AE001BA;*Scream*
1154;AE001BB;*Scream*
1513;AE001BC;*Scream*
936;AE001BD;*Scream*
2170;AE001BE;*Scream*
322;AE001CA;Ha!
412;AE001CB;Ha!
536;AE001DA;Whoa!
508;AE001DB;Ha!
350;AE001DC;Ha!
246;AE001DD;Ha!
1825;AE001V;Ha!
1942;AE001W;Ha!
1950;AE001X;Ha!
1493;AE001Y;Ha!
675;AE001Z;Ha!
350;AE001ZA;Ha!
2508;AE001_001;You must be the newbie. Shall we start?
8099;AE001_002;Our job today is to direct traffic. You see, today is open house, and we're expecting a lot of visitors. It's going to be a busy day.
7224;AE001_003;You might be familiar with directing traffic, but there are tanks and powered exoskeletons in the base, so you gotta watch out!
6350;AE001_004;Now we're at the underground warehouse. This is the only place we can borrow. Let's start our basic training.
5770;AE001_005;The base will open up to the public in the afternoon. Visitors will watch a flying show at the end of their tour.
5225;AE001_006;So that's the aerial unit. I wish I could fly too. Looking forward to your show.
1475;AE001_007;Let's check the procedures then.
8536;AE001_008;We're at the bottom of the EDF base. It's currently being used as a warehouse or a hanger. There are also some vehicles here for maintenance.
6826;AE001_009;I heard that you're a good mechanic. And you're also licensed to operate large vehicles, am I right? That's very impressive.
5968;AE001_010;And you have access to military radio systems too. Somebody must be putting a lot of trust in you.
5298;AE001_011;Our job today is to move cargo. We're going to move the cargo from the basement to the ground floor.
6470;AE001_012;What you're wearing is a powered exoskeleton. It has great strength, so you can move the cargo all by yourself.
4474;AE001_013;I heard it was developed for military use and has the same power output as a tank.
2183;AE001_014;Emergency alert. Emergency alert.
2650;AE001_015;This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill.
1501;AE001_016;Answer me. What happened?
3688;AE001_017;He was eaten. George was eaten!
1272;AE001_018;Don't worry, it's fine.
1865;AE001_019;The lights will return to normal soon.
1352;AE001_020;Okay, let's continue.
907;AE001_021;Monsters!
1442;AE001_022;Run! Run!
2996;AE001_023;Don't worry, soldiers love making jokes like these.
1036;AE001_024;Let's get to work then.
1669;AE001_025;I'll show you the way. Follow me.
482;AE001_026;This way.
3739;AE001_027;Keep up. The bottom of the base is huge. It's easy to get lost.
1494;AE001_028;Maybe something did happen.
3641;AE001_029;Watch out for the tanks. This is a vehicle only lane. Don't get hit!
1112;AE001_030;No need to be nervous.
1463;AE001_031;I'm opening the gate now.
785;AE001_032;*Scream*
1326;AE001_033;Help!
1924;AE001_034;No!
1591;AE001_035;Fire! Fire!
1398;AE001_036;It's too huge!
1464;AE001_037;Die you monster.
1716;AE001_038;What the heck are these things?
2105;AE001_039;I've never seen creatures like these before.
1811;AE001_040;They aren't surviving dinosaurs, are they?
881;AE001_041;Are you alright?
1524;AE001_042;You are a civilian, aren't you?
1554;AE001_043;Come, I'll give you a weapon.
5182;AE001_044;This is an emergency. Our current location, the base underground, is being invaded by monsters.
3147;AE001_044B;This is an emergency! The base is being attacked by monsters!
4410;AE001_045;We don't know what they are and how many there are, and we don't know how they got to the underground.
4342;AE001_045B;We don't know what they are and how many there are, and we don't know how they infiltrated us.
2935;AE001_046;We can't make contact with the ground. We're isolated.
4566;AE001_047;Before the reinforcements arrive, we are on our own. That is why I'm arming you.
12195;AE001_048;As soldiers it's our duty to protect civilians. Although I would like to guarantee your safety, I can't make that promise as long as the identity of the enemy is unknown. Use your weapon to protect yourself if you're in danger.
1985;AE001_049;Now I'm going to teach you how to use it.
2141;AE001_050;Guess now you won't get in your own way.
1226;AE001_051;Good, come with me.
4751;AE001_052;The blast door came down when the alert system was triggered. Looks like we have to take a detour.
817;AE001_053;I see.
3060;AE001_054;I can unlock the blast doors then everyone can escape.
3368;AE001_055;I'll take the lead. You guys watch my back and stay close.
4556;AE001_056;Hey, civilian. We might be running into some monsters. Take care of yourself, got it?
2339;AE002AA;*Scream*
1870;AE002AB;*Scream*
2399;AE002AC;*Scream*
1986;AE002BA;*Scream*
1701;AE002BB;*Scream*
1775;AE002BC;*Scream*
1506;AE002BD;*Scream*
1462;AE002BE;*Scream*
429;AE002CA;Ha!
569;AE002CB;Ha!
523;AE002DA;Yeah!
713;AE002DB;Yeah!
363;AE002DC;Yeah!
830;AE002DD;Yeah!
2353;AE002V;*Scream*
1921;AE002W;*Scream*
1913;AE002X;*Scream*
1091;AE002Y;*Scream*
825;AE002Z;*Scream*
534;AE002ZA;Yeah!
1734;AE002_001;Let's move. Follow me.
2668;AE002_002;Monsters might be hiding. Stay alert.
3036;AE002_003;Civilian, keep up. Stay close if you want to live.
1425;AE002_004;Watch your surroundings.
1551;AE002_005;This your first time holding a gun?
1315;AE002_006;Try to hold it together.
3567;AE002_007;Aim at enemy, then pull the trigger. Easy, huh?
1732;AE002_008;And your hands can't be shaking.
3311;AE002_009;The monsters are still close by, but I can't believe it.
2470;AE002_010;We're getting out of here, straight to the surface.
1221;AE002_011;Head to the elevator.
1462;AE002_012;The elevator is this way.
837;AE002_013;Here we are.
1590;AE002_014;Unlock the blast door.
1614;AE002_015;Eat that, monster!
1884;AE002_016;I like my steak well done.
2418;AE002_017;It's barbecue time!
1276;AE002_018;Hey, they're too many!
982;AE002_019;Save us!
1008;AE002_020;Monsters!
1218;AE002_021;They're attacking our men!
1478;AE002_022;Attack the monsters!
2399;AE002_023;God damn monsters, I'll burn ya!
1206;AE002_024;There are just too many!
1247;AE002_025;How can they be so big?
3139;AE002_026;Look at the fangs! If you get bitten you will die!
2312;AE002_027;Kill them all! Spare no one!
1293;AE002_028;Let's finish our job!
2882;AE002_029;We were ambushed. Everyone else is dead.
3078;AE002_030;We're saved! What on earth happened?
1699;AE002_031;Let's escape from underground!
1253;AE002_032;Head to the elevator!
3388;AE002_033;The elevator is not moving. The cables are all destroyed.
2610;AE002_034;This route doesn't work. Let's head back.
1928;AE002_035;Since we can't use the elevator.
4530;AE002_036;There's a passage for AFVs. Let's go through that passage to the surface.
3380;AE002_037;Take the pathway for AFVs, beware of the slope.
2253;AE002_038;I never thought the base would be under attack.
1976;AE002_039;Why isn't there any contact from the ground force?
2433;AE002_040;They must be busy prepping the rescue teams now.
2656;AE002_041;We still have one more trick up our sleeve.
3739;AE002_042;There should be a powered exoskeleton hanger on the floor above.
1498;AE002_043;Let's move to the hanger quickly.
3667;AE002_044;As long as we have powered exoskeletons, we won't lose to those monsters.
766;AE002_045;I heard something.
840;AE002_046;What was that sound?
754;AE002_047;Monsters!
401;AE002_048;Danger!
1031;AE002_049;Let's go for help!
1090;AE002_050;Go in for backup!
1082;AE002_051;We're surrounded!
1725;AE002_052;Damn! They're flanking us!
2442;AE002_053;We have to fight for survival. Let's do it!
2786;AE002_054;Die, you monster! Die! Die!
1766;AE002_055;Calm down, keep it together.
1224;AE002_056;I can't take it anymore!
3438;AE002_057;Never in my wildest dreams could I have thought I would be fighting monsters.
2495;AE002_058;Well done, you seem to have some talent.
1840;AE002_059;We'd better get the hell out of here!
1764;AE002_060;Let's go! Follow me!
2790;AE002_061;There should be powered exoskeletons in the hangar!
1415;AE002_062;Do you mean the robot like things?
2540;AE002_063;Can anyone operate a powered exoskeleton?
1608;AE002_064;Sergeant has a license for it.
946;AE002_065;Leave it to me!
2334;AE002_066;This is it! I'm opening the gate now!
1218;AE002_067;*Scream*
713;AE002_068;Monsters!
1467;AE002_069;Fire! Fire!
3091;AE002_070;Damn it! The powered exoskeletons have been destroyed!
1302;AE002_071;They're all destroyed!
2252;AE002_072;Anyways, just defeat the enemies!
1362;AE002_073;Monsters incoming!
2348;AE002_074;Those creatures ate their way through the wall to get in!
2526;AE002_075;Those creatures ate their way through the ceilings to get in!
2769;AE002_076;Looks like there's no functioning powered exoskeleton left.
2549;AE002_077;They're all gone. We're screwed.
1978;AE002_078;Forget it! Let's get out of here!
961;AE002_079;Follow me!
1544;AE002_080;Proceed cautiously.
4384;AE002_081;Did the ground unit fall asleep or what? The monsters are crawling all over the place.
1862;AE002_082;The rescue teams will definitely come.
818;AE002_083;Monsters!
1555;AE002_084;How many monsters are there?
1403;AE002_085;Fire at will!
2072;AE002_086;Why are the monsters attacking the base?
1645;AE002_087;This way! Follow me!
2480;AE002_088;Did that monster escape from a zoo or something?
6598;AE002_089;This is weird. We're talking about a horde of 10 meter monsters, and no one noticed a thing before the shit hit the fan?
1260;AE002_090;Maybe they were hiding somewhere.
756;AE002_091;*Scream*
1072;AE002_092;That was close!
722;AE002_093;Back up!
1348;AE002_094;The ceiling is collapsing!
1057;AE002_095;The route is blocked!
1089;AE002_096;Monsters incoming!
1565;AE002_097;There's a hole in the ceiling!
1496;AE002_098;Monsters are coming from the hole!
1571;AE002_099;There are just way too many!
1831;AE002_100;Where the hell do those things come from?
935;AE002_101;What a nightmare!
3356;AE002_102;I already have insomnia, who's gonna pay if it gets worse?
2582;AE002_103;Maybe think about how you're gonna survive first!
1992;AE002_104;Why aren't the rescue teams here yet?
1990;AE002_105;Those things are spitting acid at us!
1472;AE002_106;Are they trying to melt us?
2672;AE002_107;You gotta be kidding me. I don't want to die like that.
3567;AE002_108;It's no joke if you get spit on. We must kill them before they get us.
1302;AE002_109;We'll change route.
2452;AE002_110;I'll open the blast door now, back off!
1125;AE002_111;Monsters!
602;AE002_112;Damn!
1524;AE002_113;Take out all monsters!
2162;AE002_114;Head to the ground surface. Follow me!
1401;AE002_115;This way! Hurry up!
1461;AE002_116;Hey, it's this way.
2050;AE002_117;Hey! Wrong way! Over here!
2062;AE002_118;We'll wait here. Come here quick.
2347;AE002_119;Hey, civilian! Come here quick!
3065;AE002_120;This is an emergency! You have to join the fight too, civilian!
2833;AE002_121;If you don't fight you will become their food.
2824;AE002_122;Don't say that, we'll do our best to protect you.
945;AE002_123;Monsters again!
2791;AE002_124;I'm ready to fight, but not against so many.
1551;AE002_125;Is this the monsters realm?
2619;AE002_126;We'll be safe when we reach the surface. Let's go!
600;AE002_127;This way!
1317;AE002_128;Keep moving forward!
1330;AE002_129;You have some talent!
2030;AE002_130;Contact! A large group of monsters!
1716;AE002_131;Behind this blast door!
2362;AE002_132;There might be monsters, stay alert!
2126;AE002_133;I'm opening the blast door now!
3162;AE002_134;Hold on, Sergeant. I need some mental preparation.
3162;AE002_135;I'm sure there are tons of monsters on the other side of the door.
2410;AE002_136;Ready? I'm unlocking it now!
1394;AE002_137;Ha!
1545;AE002_138;Huh? What the...
1765;AE002_139;Man, that was scary.
1116;AE002_140;Let's move on!
1218;AE002_141;Ah, good grief!
1975;AE002_142;Why isn't there any response from the ground force?
1283;AE002_143;Maybe something happened.
3707;AE002_144;No matter what happened, their situation can't be worse than ours.
2722;AE002_145;You handled yourself pretty well back there for a civilian.
2979;AE002_146;You've got what it takes to be a soldier. You want to join us?
6835;AE002_147;Can somebody answer me? We are fighting the monsters underground, calling in for backup. It's no use.
4474;AE002_148;Please come in, requesting surface sitrep. Damn!
3930;AE002_149;The rescue team should have been here by now. What the hell is going on?
1882;AE002_150;Why didn't the rescue teams come?
4921;AE002_151;The rescue team will be here soon. They must be standing by on the ground surface now.
1781;AE002_152;We are close to the surface now!
4966;AE002_153;The rescue team must be waiting on the surface. We'll be safe once we get out from here.
3060;AE002_154;We'll be safe once we are on the surface. Now move it.
3890;AE002_155;The exit is not far. We'll be fine once we get back to the surface.
3823;AE002_156;Maybe the monsters are biological weapons created by another nation.
948;AE002_157;That's ridiculous.
3576;AE002_158;Nothing's more terrifying than an army of monstrous living creatures.
8969;AE002_159;I read about this in a sci-fi novel. In the story, a bunch of rats got into a spaceship. They kept multiplying and they ended up eating all the food.
2908;AE002_160;Unlike machines living creatures can reproduce.
3887;AE002_161;Hey, wait a minute. Are you saying that there will be more monsters?
1670;AE002_162;Sergeant, you are okay?
2967;AE002_163;I'm going to the surface. Open the blast door.
3074;AE002_164;No way, it's likely that there are monsters on the other side.
1069;AE002_165;I see.
3714;AE002_166;But this is the only route. We have to exterminate the monsters.
1566;AE002_167;Open the blast door.
709;AE002_168;Yes sir!
1284;AE002_169;There are more than I thought!
1067;AE002_170;They are way too many!
2589;AE002_171;Nothing to fear, exterminate them all!
2737;AE002_172;Hey civilian, that was quite impressive.
4041;AE002_173;After we get out, visit the army recruiter. He'll help you with the paperwork.
2818;AE002_174;This is the exit. We can meet up with our unit.
2395;AE002_175;Don't worry, civilian. We're safe now.

3841;AE003_002;Those idiots on the ground. We took out all the monsters by ourselves.
2309;AE003_003;They'll freak out when they hear the monsters are all dead.
1629;AE003_004;What? What's going on?
1227;AE003_005;There's still that many?
2631;AE003_006;This is Iota 2, ready to fight some monsters.
6350;AE003_007;The only functioning powered exoskeleton is Iota 2. Iota 2. Protect all activated powered exoskeletons.
1576;AE003_008;This is Iota 2, Roger that!
1076;AE003_009;The armors melting!
2279;AE003_010;*Scream*
1984;AE003_011;Hey! Look at the sky!
1574;AE003_012;I can't believe that!
1281;AE003_013;They are flying saucers!
2984;AE003_014;Do you mean UFOs? That's ridiculous.
2708;AE003_015;Did they start shooting a movie in the base while we were gone?
1144;AE003_016;Die, you monster!
2878;AE003_017;He killed my comrade! Time for revenge!
2408;AE003_018;Looks like the monster's spitting something!
3620;AE003_019;Ah! It's acid! It's bloody acid!
3394;AE003_020;Don't be afraid! Our combat suits are acid resistant!
4034;AE003_021;Oh, no. Help! Help! *Scream*
1367;AE003_022;Incoming monsters!
1749;AE003_023;All units get in position.
1929;AE003_024;Anyone capable of moving must fight.
2524;AE003_025;Shoot them! Don't let the monsters get any closer!
2947;AE003_026;This is Iota 3, Commencing Initiation Procedure.
2571;AE003_027;Infantry. Protect the powered exoskeleton.
4926;AE003_028;Crap! Can't believe that the powered exoskeleton can't be activated in such a crucial moment!
2756;AE003_029;There are too many enemies. Evacuate the Civilians!
3011;AE003_030;They should be all evacuated by now, but we can't be sure of that.
2280;AE003_031;We can't reach the corporal in charge of the escort.
1871;AE003_032;There are monsters everywhere!
3401;AE003_033;It was safer underground, we should have stayed down there.
1782;AE003_034;It's much more dangerous on the surface.
3386;AE003_035;Our troops are in combat! We should back them up! Follow me!
3777;AE003_036;This is Iota 1, activation sequence has reached final phase.
1611;AE003_037;Incoming monsters!
1366;AE003_038;There are so many!
3093;AE003_039;Keep the monsters away from the powered exoskeletons!
4771;AE003_040;Monsters plus UFOs? Crap. The most disgusting combo.
3827;AE003_041;Iota 1 is activated. Powered exoskeleton team, engage.
1906;AE003_042;Sergeant, glad to know you're fine.
2959;AE003_043;Give me a sitrep! Where is the second lieutenant?
2769;AE003_044;The lieutenant was killed in action, eaten by a monster.
655;AE003_045;Damn!
1895;AE003_046;There is one monster left!
2893;AE003_047;All exterminated. It's finally over.
785;AE004AA;Fire!
605;AE004AB;Fire!
612;AE004AC;Fire!
1041;AE004BA;Fire!
545;AE004BB;Fire!

1358;AE004V;Shoot them dead!
772;AE004W;Is it done?
830;AE004X;Go to hell!
632;AE004Y;Watch this.
877;AE004Z;Take this!
722;AE004ZA;Ha!
1403;AE004_001;Is that the mothership?
3930;AE004_002;Ground units attack the monsters. The Air Force will handle the mothership.
3718;AE004_003;AFVs move out, infantry move with the AFVs.
1767;AE004_004;Incoming flying saucers!
1442;AE004_005;Attack the flying saucers.
1625;AE004_006;Flying saucers approaching!
2026;AE004_007;More flying saucers than expected!
2935;AE004_008;Do not fear, shoot down the flying saucers.
2210;AE004_009;Incoming, monsters!
1689;AE004_010;Exterminate the monsters!
3762;AE004_011;Air Force strike to the mothership. Count down. Five minutes.
1484;AE004_012;The mothership is ascending!
1120;AE004_013;Is it trying to flee?
4560;AE004_014;Something's approaching. It's alien flying ships!
1381;AE004_015;What are those?
1474;AE004_016;They're flying in the air!
1873;AE004_017;Look! Something's piloting it!
2044;AE004_018;Something is descending from the flying ship!
1378;AE004_019;Something is coming out!
2047;AE004_020;I can't believe it! They're aliens!
2213;AE004_021;Aliens are descending from the flying ship!
2774;AE004_022;So that is the enemy's landing ship.
1446;AE004_023;The aliens have weapons!
3907;AE004_024;That alien is a soldier! The alien infantry is here!
2930;AE004_025;They're coming! We'll be killed if we don't fight back!
1360;AE004_026;Fire! Fire!
594;AE004_027;Back up!
1684;AE004_028;It's the alien infantry unit!
2200;AE004_029;Aliens have finally landed on Earth!
2299;AE004_030;Are they aliens? They look like humans!
4186;AE004_031;Permission to engage with aliens granted, ground units, engage the aliens.
1966;AE004_032;Describe what the aliens look like.
3028;AE004_033;Just like us, they have limbs a head and two eyes!
3601;AE004_034;They look just like us! The resemblance is unbelievable!
3344;AE004_035;They have mouths too? Looks like they're talking!
3663;AE004_036;So they have their own language, just like us.
3558;AE004_037;This is Gamma team, we are engaging an alien infantry unit!
2007;AE004_038;More aliens are landing on the ground!
3148;AE004_039;Fall back! Fall back!
2547;AE004_040;Hold your ground! No way we're handing over the city!
1893;AE004_041;They're attacking!
2830;AE004_042;The enemies are hiding in the shadows of buildings!
2232;AE004_043;Those bastards! Move in!
2503;AE004_044;Show them what the EDF infantry is made of!
2654;AE004_045;The enemies are attacking from the sides!
2045;AE004_046;What? No! Back off!
1261;AE004_047;They're firing at us!
1406;AE004_048;*Scream*
2667;AE004_049;Fall back! Fall back!
6251;AE004_050;This is team Gamma! The enemy is trying to outmaneuver us! They're trained military soldiers!
1494;AE004_051;Enemy on the left, too!
1945;AE004_052;*Scream*
1481;AE004_053;One alien remaining!
2341;AE004_054;All aliens on the ground have been exterminated.
804;AE004_055;Good job.
1526;AE004_056;There are more in the air!
1631;AE004_057;Alien landing ships!
2916;AE004_058;Something is landing! Looks like robots!
2004;AE004_059;Did you say, robots?
1247;AE004_060;What exactly are these?
1642;AE004_061;They're different from the ones before.
1407;AE004_062;Incoming robots!
2368;AE004_063;First Aliens, and now a robot army?
1328;AE004_064;It's a robot army!
1848;AE004_065;The robots are taking over the city!
4773;AE004_066;No way we're losing the ground battle. Hold the front line. Earth belongs to us!
1672;AE004_067;These things aren't robots!
2362;AE004_068;They are aliens in space suits!
1653;AE004_069;They're aliens inside!
1183;AE004_070;What exactly are they?
1507;AE004_071;They look disgusting!
2665;AE004_072;Unlike the ones before, these aren't humanoids.
1795;AE004_073;They don't look like humans at all!
3465;AE004_074;What? Aliens with a different appearance compared to humans?
4609;AE004_075;I won't allow any unlawful occupation, even if you are aliens!
3459;AE004_076;These guys are trained! They're alien special forces!
1685;AE004_077;Those aliens know teamwork!
2253;AE004_078;These soldiers are big but agile!
1906;AE004_079;The enemies are coming from the right side!
1286;AE004_080;It's a decoy!
1345;AE004_081;They're coming from the left!
1865;AE004_082;*Scream*
2100;AE004_083;Back off or we'll be annihilated!
3229;AE004_084;From behind! They're flanking from behind!
2545;AE004_085;Run! Run! *Scream*
1069;AE005AA;Shoot them dead!
1296;AE005AB;Shoot them dead!
876;AE005AC;Shoot them dead!
1024;AE005BA;Go to hell!
1247;AE005BB;Go to hell!
1252;AE005BC;Go to hell!
1029;AE005BD;Go to hell!
871;AE005BE;Go to hell!

991;AE005X;Watch this!
775;AE005Y;You're a goner!
658;AE005Z;Watch me.
608;AE005ZA;Fire!
2266;AE005_001;Mysterious monster Erginus, confirmed.
3216;AE005_002;Getting into the shooting range of EMC. Moving in.
949;AE005_003;Move forward!
1548;AE005_006;Erginus is unresponsive.
4240;AE005_008;EMC is short range, so get close to the target now before it's too late.
1680;AE005_009;Don't attack before we're close enough.
1945;AE005_010;So that's the mysterious monster?
900;AE005_011;It's huge!
1538;AE005_013;All vehicles halt!
5086;AE005_014;The previous air strikes already immobilized Erginus. We'll kill it during the next round of attack.
4223;AE005_015;Each EMC costs 100 million dollars to build, and they're useless?
773;AE005_020;We did it!
1060;AE005_021;Is it dead yet?
1386;AE005_022;Erginus is back up again!
1167;AE005_023;It's still alive!
1636;AE005_024;It survived the airstrike!
6157;AE005_025;Survived? We didn't even make a scratch. It wasn't immobilized either. It was just taking a goddamn nap!
1534;AE005_026;It's coming towards us!
1335;AE005_027;It's really mad!
1902;AE005_028;Fire! Open fire!
1744;AE005_030;EMC! Ready to fire!
4612;AE005_031;Adjust the azimuth, lock on target, increase power output.
1601;AE005_032;EMC! Fire!
724;AE005_033;It worked!
1169;AE005_034;Yeah!
1110;AE005_035;Enemy confirmed.
2860;AE005_037;It's a new enemy! That's a mysterious monster!
1559;AE005_040;All vehicles, spread out!
1165;AE005_041;Formation beta!
580;AE005_043;Look!
1762;AE005_044;It's the mysterious monster!
938;AE005_045;Permission to attack!
708;AE005_048;Fire!
1321;AE005_049;It's rolling towards us!
1541;AE005_050;It curled into a ball!
3000;AE005_051;That mysterious monster is spitting lava-like substances.
1182;AE005_052;An explosion!
3663;AE005_053;That lava-like substance exploded the moment it was exposed to air!
1848;AE005_054;That creature is a living powder keg!
2789;AE005_057;The system won't hold if we keep boosting the energy!
725;AE006AA;Shoot!
896;AE006AB;Shoot!
487;AE006AC;Shoot!
1074;AE006BA;Watch this!
1090;AE006BB;Watch this!
1238;AE006BC;Watch this!

1115;AE006W;In my sight!
942;AE006X;Drop dead!
1063;AE006Y;Don't look down on me!
753;AE006Z;Now!
574;AE006ZA;Shoot!
1763;AE006_001;We've approached the mothership successfully!
1816;AE006_002;Good. Destroy the mothership.
2221;AE006_003;Attacking the mothership right from below might work.
2266;AE006_004;Flying saucers are coming out from the mothership!
1834;AE006_005;Flying saucers are coming!
1059;AE006_006;They're attacking!
1457;AE006_007;Fight the flying saucers!
8203;AE006_008;The flying saucers are only unmanned drones, so we should be able to shoot them down with infantry weapons. All units, start anti-aircraft attacks.
1219;AE006_009;Monsters!
1143;AE006_010;Attack the monsters.
1557;AE006_011;Flying saucers again!
2378;AE006_012;Flying saucers are coming out from the mothership!
1445;AE006_013;Attack the flying saucers!
4508;AE006_014;The mothership seems to have immeasurable power. We can't let it cause more casualties.
2444;AE006_015;All units, retreat. We have to regroup.
858;AE007AA;Attack!
1094;AE007AB;Attack!

1019;AE007W;I'll back you up!
1143;AE007X;Don't even try.
391;AE007Y;Hit it!
633;AE007Z;Die!
1300;AE008AA;Feed them bullets!

4419;AE100_002;A powered exoskeleton hits like a truck, you don't want to get in their way.
1102;AE100_003;Make a turn here.
1189;AE100_004;Go through this room.
4664;AE100_005;This base is too large for humans, it looks like it's designed for military vehicles.
2158;AE100_006;Powered exoskeletons, make way!
2140;AE100_007;Powered exoskeletons are coming, watch out!
1261;AE100_008;Behind this gate is...
336;AE100_009;Huh?
1728;AE100_010;How is this possible?
1106;AE100_011;That was close.
866;AE100_012;Who is this?
660;AE100_013;That's right!
643;AE100_014;Good!
643;AE100_015;That's it!
1091;AE100_016;You got talent!
1025;AE100_017;Not bad.
697;AE100_018;Good call.
599;AE100_019;Pretty good.
804;AE100_020;Not bad.
1425;AE100_021;Not even close.
976;AE100_022;Do it again!
915;AE100_023;Focus!
1206;AE100_024;Were you even listening?
1080;AE100_025;Pull it together!
1114;AE100_026;Concentrate!
765;AE100_027;Don't you quit.
754;AE100_028;Almost there.
847;AE100_029;Nice.
939;AE100_030;Not bad.
1032;AE100_031;Impressive.
696;AE100_032;Well done!
763;AE100_033;You passed.
929;AE100_034;Huh? What happened?
556;AE100_035;Again?
1245;AE100_036;Something wrong with the circuit?
2356;AE100_037;Just switch on the light and it'll be fine.
3111;AE102_001;Is this true? What if we're wrong?
28142;AE102_002;This is a special news flash. There have been accounts of UFO sightings everywhere across the globe. And this time, the UFOs aren't just moving flashes of light caught on camera. According to eyewitnesses, they saw flying objects made of metal. For now, the identity of these objects remains unclear. Since there are reports of sightings coming from everywhere, it is speculated that there are multiple UFOs flying in different areas.
1362;AE103_001;What's with that flying saucer?
3386;AE103_002;This is the powered exoskeleton team. We're ready to engage!
1143;AE103_003;Look at the sky!
1329;AE103_004;Something is falling!
1771;AE103_005;Retreat! Find cover!
2443;AE103_006;*Scream*
1412;AE103_007;They're giant pylons!
1576;AE103_008;They look mechanical!
2406;AE103_009;Monsters! They appear around the pylon!
2688;AE103_010;So the monsters are transported by that pylon?!
4527;AE103_011;The pylon came from the sky! That means the monsters also came from the sky!
1293;AE103_012;Attack the monsters!
1492;AE103_013;Look, pylons!
3315;AE103_014;There are so many! Will they bring in more monsters?
2114;AE103_015;At this rate it'll become a monster nation!
3624;AE103_016;If the pylon falls into the city, it will cause heavy casualties!
2671;AE103_017;Not only casualties, the whole city will be gone!
1220;AE103_018;What is going on?!
2102;AE103_019;What in the world are we fighting against?!
1883;AE103_020;This is more than an act of terrorism!
2128;AE103_021;Does that mean we're at war with some country?
1836;AE103_022;This is the world at war!
5095;AE103_023;The pylons seem to be a device for teleporting monsters. They keep coming, one after another!
2051;AE103_024;The monsters are increasing in number!
2247;AE103_025;We must destroy the pylons! Attack!
6101;AE103_026;It's the device on the top part of the pylon that is calling in the monsters! We might be able to stop it if we attack!
2206;AE103_027;Aim at the upper part of the pylons!
942;AE103_028;Awesome.
4171;AE103_029;We did it! The pylon can be destroyed by attacking the upper part!
2710;AE103_030;Attack the upper part of the pylon and destroy it!
4287;AE103_031;Damn, I was about to travel abroad next week. Just my luck.
4523;AE103_032;Well my friend in Europe just told me that Marseille is being attacked by thousands of monsters.
2577;AE103_033;Are you saying that we're not the only ones being attacked?
2617;AE103_034;It seems that monsters have appeared in Osaka too!
2082;AE103_035;A horde of UFOs were sighted, too!
5667;AE103_036;There's great confusion in the media right now, so keep it cool and don't start going around spreading rumors.
17599;AE103_037;This is a follow-up report on the UFOs. A monster has appeared in the same area where a UFO was previously sighted. It is said to be 10 meters long, extremely aggressive, and will most likely attack humans. Stay tuned for more updates.
16687;AE103_038;This is a special news flash. There have been multiple sightings of monsters in different areas. They can be highly dangerous, so please act with extreme caution in case you witness these monsters. Do not make an attempt to approach and report to the authority immediately.
747;AE103_039;Good job!
2383;AE103_040;Take down all of the monsters. Spare no one.
2724;AE103_041;I want to know where the pylon is coming from!
5051;AE103_042;It seems that it was dropped from the giant flying saucer. We don't know any more details other than that.
1507;AE103_043;A flying saucer!
1837;AE103_044;Look up! Pylons!
1341;AE103_045;They're crashing down here!
2782;AE103_046;There's too many of them! This base won't make it!
1362;AE103_047;Look up! Pylons!
1246;AE103_048;They will crash down here!
2789;AE103_049;There's too many of them! This base won't make it!
2308;AE103_050;Abandon the base. Evacuate now.
3914;AE103_051;We need to evacuate. Come with me. I'll take you to somewhere safe.
2133;AE104_001;So, the war has begun.
1785;AE104_002;Those things are attacking the city!
3840;AE104_003;People here are all civilians. We can't just let those monsters attack them.
3065;AE104_004;Attack the monsters and stop the disaster from spreading.
1146;AE104_005;Tanks, move out!
1712;AE104_006;The tanks will support the infantry.
6170;AE104_007;Sergeant, perfect timing. Please support us. There's no time to waste. We must minimize the casualties.
2274;AE104_008;I see! We will join the fight!
6366;AE104_009;Sergeant, move with tanks. They can block off the acid from the monsters. Once the monsters get close, move with the tanks.
1855;AE104_010;Damn! There's no time for rest!
1210;AE104_011;Is anywhere safe?
3529;AE104_012;All we can do is fight, protect the civilians!
2876;AE104_013;Destroy the pylons before they ruin the city!
2708;AE104_014;The city will be doomed if we don't destroy the pylons!
2183;AE104_015;Which freaking country made these weapons?
6297;AE104_016;How can anyone create those horrible things? I'll find out who's behind all this horrible stuff and teach the guy a lesson.
1900;AE104_017;If only they were created by man.
2113;AE104_018;Looks like it's not safe here either.
4785;AE104_019;I promise I will take you to a safe place this time after we deal with the pylons.
2045;AE104_020;Sergeant, thank you for your support.
2870;AE104_021;Please tell me, when will we start a counter-attack?
8323;AE104_022;Sergeant, the enemy is much stronger than you can imagine. The whole world is being attacked right now. We already have our hands full with managing the situation.
4763;AE104_023;Not even the EDF can withstand them. Looks like this attack was well planned.
1486;AE104_024;Citizens are being attacked!
1567;AE104_025;Attack the monsters!
4495;AE104_026;All available units, attack the monsters now. Wipe them out, ASAP.
12817;AE104_027;Here is a follow-up report on the flying objects. They seem to be dropping monsters in various different places. The flying objects are extremely dangerous, so we urge you to keep a safe distance if you come across one.
20074;AE104_028;So far the identity of the flying objects remains unclear, as governments worldwide deny involvement. And it hasn't been confirmed whether other organizations are involved. Although the government promised to clarify the situation, the current state is in chaos for authorities in question, so the situation remains obscure.
4237;AE104_029;This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. We will support you in the combat.
1128;AE104_030;Thank you for the support.
5226;AE104_031;Based on the falling trajectories of the pylons, we've determined the location of the gigantic ship.
2242;AE104_032;So that's the ship that deploys those pylons.
5714;AE104_033;It's flying above the combat area now. It may deploy pylons. Please be on high alert to the sky.
537;AE104_034;Look!
1410;AE104_035;Pylons are crashing down!
2759;AE104_036;Crap! Who the hell is behind all this?
3215;AE104_037;Destroy the pylons before they cause more damage!
2208;AE104_038;Aim at the upper part of the pylons!
3811;AE104_039;Help us! Monsters! There are monsters outside my home!
4346;AE104_040;I saw monsters! My friend was eaten! Please send someone over!
