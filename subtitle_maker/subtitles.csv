512;AM061AC;Thank you.
1600;AE152_005;We should do this ourselves then!
1733;AE125_021;Artillery fire incoming!
5386;AEX02_022;This is the rescue chopper. There are no units located at the assigned coordinates. What's the situation?
2300;AE186_054;FLY TYPES DEPLOYING FOR THE NEST!
796;AM072AA;Are you sure?
2413;AN005Z;We'll go to hell ourselves, don't you die.
2868;AEX04_201;Once we've crossed this area, we can rest. Keep it up!
2542;AT104CB;I got caught in the web. Set me free!
1537;AA065AB;We have defeated all enemies.
1567;AA065AA;We have defeated all enemies!
2921;AEX04_081;Air raid is completed. Continue the operation.
7624;AU021BB;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1606;AT107DB;Stay away! It's a trap!
1482;AE055BE;Attacking the enemy now!
1345;AE132_011;Let's secure the area!
1177;AE121_052;Shoot down the drones!
1648;AL006AB;WAR!
2216;AE198_034;Barga 3! They got me good!
1031;AL019CB;Cool down the system!
970;AS005FD;Set me free!
2707;AE107_046;But you will be disappointed by the amount of the death gratuity.
1270;AA056DB;I hate idiots.
2616;AA049DD;I used to be the best pilot in the world.
2765;AEX04_112;Artillery attack completed. Continue operation.
1160;AY005BE;I owe you my life!
1309;AK012DA;Is there no end to this?
3027;AE157_011;And we can only shorten the distance. Let's dash forward!
697;AE138_042;Who are they?
1591;AM028BD;I'll treat you to a nice meal!
2179;AO019BD;The ammo doesn't come out, the gun's jammed!
3544;AT307DD;You almost blew me away along with the web! Be careful!
2256;AL034BD;I hope this is the final part.
433;AM070W;Thank you.
2242;AT007BE;It's pulling me away! Somebody help!
2857;AA094BB;I'm not afraid of the enemy, but the darkness.
1417;AB007Y;I... I'll do my best.
2596;AE140_023;The Grim Reapers have arrived! Go join them!
2685;AE143_067;The aliens could also be clone soldiers.
6799;AU112DA;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
2427;AE206_008;A unit is attacking Mothership Eleven!
880;AN024BD;Let's go together.
1926;AEX04_487;IT'S HEAVY ARMORED ALIENS!
5303;AE210_064;If we destroy the command ship, it will turn the tide! Hurry! Destroy it before they gather up!
1972;AE121_049;The drones are dispatched from the base!
1742;AL015DD;We took down the last one!
1267;AL014BA;NEUTRALIZED!
4096;AE139_023;Sergeant, leave at once. There are countless monsters heading your way.
1440;AM153BB;Oh, is that right?
1029;AE054BE;Attacking now!
608;AQ003EA;Ugh!
1492;AB008Y;I'm starting to feel tired.
1672;AE004_067;These things aren't robots!
1595;AK003DC;Let's check the enemy from above!
1083;AM011AA;Just like that!
629;AL021AA;It's done
2999;AA119BE;I don't want my pension anymore, I want a discharge!
1661;AN031DA;I'm all yours, hero.
784;AL006DC;YEAH!
1070;AA058DC;Why did you enlist?
1864;AE113_029;Looks like I was saved by the newbie.
5185;AE005_012;Please run as soon as possible.
1860;AA036W;I'll ruin all of their plans.
1966;AE004_032;Describe what the aliens look like.
1601;AO005Z;Cooling down. Back me up!
1652;AD011AC;Don't shoot! Too far!
966;AM205BD;Seriously?
1145;AM076DB;That's common sense!
1706;AE060BD;Don't come! Stay away!
617;AM045BB;Yes sir!
2786;AE125_032;Artillery unit has been eliminated! We can win this!
2753;AE116_006;They're trying to kill us! Don't hesitate!
1787;AN030BA;Wow! It's you!
1516;AZ003H;Show them what we really have.
1960;AE169_003;We've confirmed bigger objects!
427;AB004CB;GO!
1529;AE195_017;AAAAAAAAAA
1649;AA052AB;Calm down, no danger.
1638;AL019BC;We just killed the last one!
1430;AF003Z;They didn't even notice us.
891;AP009DA;One down!
1083;AB007X;They want us to run!
1069;AE005AA;Shoot them, Dad!
2789;AE005_057;The system won't hold if we keep boosting the energy!
1286;AE004_080;IT'S A DECOY!
3020;AE113_036;Then let's do it. We will win this battle as well.
339;AM044BD;Got it!
6757;AU152AA;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dust till dawn?
4361;AE114_035;Something is approaching! It's alien flying ships!
807;AY069BC;Don't worry.
833;AE129_034;We've been found!
1429;AI005BE;The injury is nothing!
2295;AN036BA;You must be the ace. Nice to meet you.
2284;AO007AC;Reloading! Back me up for two seconds!
679;AE198_008;Detach!
1708;AE210_078;A LASER CANNON!
1204;AT111BE;Destroy the web!
818;AL003AB;E.D.F.
1219;AL015Y;Hooray!
1216;AA022DB;Let's do it elegantly.
3157;AE155_030;There's one monster left! Watch out for the threads!
1048;AE020AB;Take aim at the right!
4181;AE164_007;Anyway, let's eliminate the nearby enemies first. Destroy the shield bearers.
2959;AE124_003;Damn! We aren't strong enough to put up a fight!
4506;AE180_019;The enemy is too small to land a direct hit. Lean your upper body forward.
656;AM001ZA;Hold on!
1640;AM192BD;I simply wanted to do so.
573;AZ018PB;Shoot!
2734;AE115_031;Even so, it'll still buy us some time.
1393;AE168_027;Watch out for those webs!
2249;AA028BE;I want to eat barbecued meat now!
8203;AE006_008;The flying saucers are only unmanned drones, so we should be able to shoot them down with infantry weapons. All units, start anti-aircraft attacks!
1356;AA008DB;A nice breeze of wind.
1947;AL026DC;The opponent got nothing on me.
996;AA033BE;Come back alive!
1847;AN010V;Storm One, I'll back you up!
439;AM074AC;WOAH
1334;AEX04_159;Secure this location!
2958;AE114_046;They're coming! We will get killed if we don't strike back!
1213;AL042BB;I'm alive
4459;AE168_037;The dense fog clears up sometimes. Attack the moment the fog disperses.
1606;AE210_126;Aim at the center of the command ship!
1178;AE139_016;That's amazing!
855;AB003AB;Let's go!
1858;AE114_091;No! It's too late!
1991;AA019BB;I can't possibly die.
1699;AEX04_639;Fencer! We're counting on you!
864;AM166DA;WHAT HAPPENED?!
2400;AE210_073;Destroy it! Destroy it now!
1681;AT004CB;Take down that creature!
2099;AE180_030;Defeat the monsters! Protect Barga!
1354;AO031BB;Swap the cartridge!
902;AD003CA;Prepare to shoot!
1337;AJ003DC;IS IT THE BACKUP HERE YET?!
451;AY052BB;Bye-bye!
546;AM059DC;That's right.
1714;AR026BB;I WANT REVENGE!
486;AH020BC;WE'RE HIT!
1564;AM185BB;This is for revenge.
1034;AM150BB;Alright, I got it!
2540;AE133_004;Let's go! On your toes, everyone!
7563;AU031CB;High up in the air, our comrades fight Dashing through the sky, now like a million bolts of light
1873;AO009CA;Transfer Dry's power to weapons!
647;AH016BD;Are you hurt?
902;AL012BC;Mission Cleared!
1285;AE153_039;Next too, Roger!
5901;AE209_003;They're gathering around to protect Number 11, rather than being summoned by it. There must be a reason for this.
1165;AO028BE;SWAP THE MAGAZINE!
2033;AEX04_280;Confirmed. Alien in spacesuit.
1371;AA019AA;Did you check the guns?
1440;AA024X;I've become strong, too.
2047;AA060AC;Show them what a heavy gunfire is!
710;AE019Y;I'm shooting!
1634;AE201_006;Support the Vanguard from the rear.
1696;AR002V;How dare they kill our man!
1076;AA002EB;AHHH! AHHH!
971;AY018DB;Should be clear!
1471;AE124_004;Enemy's coming again!
1850;AH024BA;Captain! Please, hold on!
1099;AM127DB;Thank goodness!
602;AEX04_088;FIRE!
1975;AO020BA;WHY CAN'T I FIRE THE BULLETS?!
1460;AB013DD;I'm tired to death!
2672;AEX04_613;We've called for a sniper team. They will be here any minute.
4370;AE111_037;I don't think we can hold them off long enough for the Air Force to destroy the flying saucers!
832;AY028BC;That's funny.
2258;AA092BD;The enemy must be hiding somewhere.
2253;AN007BE;A civilian? Then I can't leave you alone.
3978;AE122_020;The results are great. I will send the data out to the world.
1318;AR005W;ONE MAN DOWN!
2029;AE107_011;I don't think we can get it done!
1097;AE018X;TAKE MY BULLET!
2601;AF028BB;Since they didn't see us, should we retreat now?
995;AN017DC;Nice meeting you.
1843;AE178_001;We've reached base 228!
968;AA067BB;Why are you here?
1792;AE157_021;So it's something like a shield.
1396;AK002BE;The enemy has been confirmed!
1972;AA009Z;Throw away your fear of death!
1992;AZ002Q;This is Transport Chopper, rived on scene.
1058;AA064BE;Why did you enlist?
1096;AR024BB;Farewell, comrade.
1795;AT003CB;IT'S PULLING ME OVER!
3204;AE107_005;Sergeant give us a hand destroy the monsters
1033;AC016BA;It's almost my turn.
2034;AE140_008;Looks like I owe you my gratitude.
2348;AQ004ZA;AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
1860;AE129_042;So the aliens can control the monsters?
2451;AE131_040;Let's pray that this operation will succeed.
724;AM012AB;That's great!
1299;AA004FA;Help me!
839;AA075BC;Is something over there?
4499;AE104_051;The helicopter squad will arrive soon. Ground troops, hold your ground before they're here.
1560;AA057DC;I don't dislike idiots.
933;AM001AC;Keep it together!
949;AI011DD;It hurts!
1563;AQ008AA;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2240;AZ006O;Sorry civilian, tell me the enemy's location.
1003;AZ028H;STOP BOMBING!
967;AO005BD;Reloading ammo.
2340;AE145_018;GET THE ENEMIES INTO THE RAILGOD'S RAGE!
1627;AA027DB;Stabilizer, condition one.
1101;AN007AC;We're under your command.
860;AB008BE;Hey, let's run!
1263;AT303CB;I barely escaped.
4447;AE176_023;AFE, rush in and distract enemies. Infantry unit, cover from behind.
1922;AC013AB;Positive enemy reaction. Stay sharp.
1221;AS002BB;AHHH!
804;AE004_055;Good job.
1458;AN035BE;I've heard everything about you!
2334;AE184_008;We found teleportation anchors under the web!
1573;AD007BD;CONFIRMED THE SHOOTING RANGE!
3573;AE063BD;N-It's too strong! That's not what I was told!
2159;AF010BB;We should be able to take down the enemy now.
2362;AE005_017;See you in the next video!
375;AQ003DC;AH
1445;AE019X;THAT'S WHAT I'M WAITING FOR!
1567;AE106_016;Second, they are tacked.
2203;AE143_037;GIANT TELEPORTATION ANCHORS SPOTTED!
3403;AT303DC;You destroyed the web. I'm alive all thanks to you.
2337;AE043AC;EDF always faces the enemy, head on!
1646;AT109BC;Over here! I'm over here!
6785;AU012AC;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs, be calm, be bald, and raise your guns!
1171;AM018BD;I'M IMPRESSED!
1481;AO004BC;I'LL SWAP MY MAGAZINES!
1527;AEX04_178;Secure this paddy field!
3125;AE116_012;This means the aliens are using the monsters as their weapon!
1387;AM019AC;This is what we're trained for!
953;AZ009L;Launch now!
2331;AE199_011;I can't believe how fast they are!
2237;AE151_010;Enemies are coming out from that area!
3707;AE140_031;You can pay me back in hell after you get your job done.
9582;AE157_028;The light barrier will block our attacks, while the aliens can fire through it from inside. It's like a magic mirror. Only the ones outside the light barrier can get hit.
585;AM039AA;WAIT!
2036;AT303AB;That was close. I owe ya.
2559;AEX04_398;There's a scout! Red monsters nearby!
1716;AE001_038;What the heck are these things?
1989;AT003Z;I'm good! I can get out myself!
739;AB007AC;KEEP GOING!
1452;AI005AB;Recover me while I recover!
1888;AA049BC;I'm a gambling genius.
2112;AA101BC;I really hate to step on the battlefield.
1372;AR011DC;One winged diver is behind!
2019;AE121_058;We can't continue like this! Retreat!
1461;AP021BD;Nice! One kill!
1714;AE129_024;THEY'RE DROPPING MONSTERS!
2026;AE210_010;Infantry units, protect the railgun.
3363;AA054BC;You didn't expect to do such a cool thing as protecting the Earth, did you?
1533;AD006Z;Confirm the enemy's position.
2604;AN020AC;I've heard rumors about you. We'll give you a hand.
6921;AE141_099;Even if we lose, we must defeat at least 70% of the enemies or we're doomed without a future.
2028;AE107_033;Oh no! We're surrounded!
6849;AE137_028;This is a record-breaking victory. I'd never expect us to defeat the enemy ships with such few people.
1434;AE038BA;IT'S SHOE TIME!
956;AP018BA;DID YOU SEE THAT?!
1681;AM199BC;I'll tell you in details later.
1685;AE199_019;We can't exterminate them all!
973;AM137BA;No one is complaining.
442;AM066BA;Forget it.
753;AY038DC;Greetings.
1870;AE105_007;They look like flying saucers!
1170;AA079BB;Don't get left behind.
2124;AE198_083;It's a 2-2-3 type based Mach 1.
987;AL011DD;E-D-F!
978;AM013DD;Not bad!
3077;AA094BC;I'm not afraid of the enemy, but the darkness.
1997;AN021BC;Hey, so nice to see you here!
647;AEX04_067;Destroyed!
1197;AB012DB;Why keep running?
2212;AA036V;Keep going! Don't be afraid of the dark!
3260;AE197_032;Damn it. Does it mean we as a species are doomed?
961;AZ019PA;Beam!
1746;AEX04_352;Teleportation ship incoming!
1431;AE140_011;So what? It's our duty!
1746;AP010BB;We did it! Direct hit!
2399;AE190_046;THERE'S SO MANY MONSTERS!
1413;AA053DC;That guy keeps looking at me.
1610;AL034BB;I hope this is the final part.
1334;AC016DB;Switch to reckless mode.
2257;AF016BD;Keep quiet or the enemy will hear us!
1056;AL046BE;I survived!
3961;AE116_016;Goddamn aliens! Rampaging on Earth as they please!
379;AM075AC;OH!
7659;AU141DD;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
6816;AU022AA;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
2189;AO021BA;The magazine is empty! What should I do?!
633;AO013DC;Landed!
1230;AM151BB;Agreed! Agreed!
604;AM035CB;Correct.
1825;AE001V;AAAAAAH!
746;AM107BB;That's not true.
1263;AM047X;That's absolutely right!
813;AM167BD;I'm in your debt.
1339;AM094DD;Wrong from the start.
1094;AE202_066;I'm looking for God.
853;AN022BB;Nice meeting you.
991;AE146_012;SHOTGUNS!
939;AY055DB;I'm going to sleep.
1508;AY009BB;Next time, I'll save you.
1304;AR033BD;Al got chewed up!
2105;AE145_045;Armor! They're wearing armor!
3614;AE143_069;If we lose the war, that could be our future too.
1878;AA078DD;I don't hate caves.
1523;AE151_009;Enemies from the side!
1544;AA035DD;Let's do this together!
2317;AW002Z;I've been kept away from Hell because of you.
1237;AM080BC;That's absolutely right.
2175;AE187_007;Have the aliens taken over this city?
1730;AO014BB;Crap! I don't have bullets!
3209;AEX02_030;Which means the monster's acid is extremely corrosive!
1158;AM206BD;Is that how it is?
1536;AD007BA;CONFIRM THE SHOOTING RANGE!
2097;AE117_026;Are you saying that there will be more monsters?
1135;AE020BC;Fire your weapon!
2469;AZ008O;Are you saying that that request was from a civilian?
1936;AL043BD;Can I be discharged after this mission?
1376;AM021BD;We can't lose!
2827;AE195_003;I can't believe there are teleportation anchors underground!
1202;AE148_008;They're starting to walk!
1709;AE142_002;THEY'RE ATTACKING THE CITIZENS!
18449;AE123_025;How do we resolve the conflicts with our neighbors? Do we use guns and bombs? No, that is not how it should be done. We engage in dialogue. That is the only way to resolve conflicts. This time we can certainly resolve our issues through dialogue as well.
2274;AQ005W;Arghhhh
539;AY052DA;Bye-bye!
1636;AF019BE;Once you fire, they will see us!
2287;AE171_022;The large teleportation anchors are initiating!
680;AP006AB;One down.
1590;AE168_028;Aranea is here somewhere!
2614;AE186_014;DIE! DIE! DIE!
2713;AE112_007;That's because we put all our hopes on the Air Force!
1658;AEX04_698;Railgun team, engage!
2692;AEX02_007;Don't bite off more than you can chew! You'll die!
1425;AA013DD;I don't regret anything.
702;AP004CB;Direct hit.
1933;AE123_016;Alien troopships are approaching!
3040;AE140_037;You know what you need? You need a code name.
1178;AF008DD;Hasn't noticed us yet.
6255;AE156_020;We have confirmed all enemies were destroyed! Mission cleared! Props to you for beating such terrifying monsters!
607;AM062BB;I'm sorry.
2128;AA003DD;I can't bring shame to the elite unit.
7791;AU171BB;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
2956;AA001CA;Immortality is ours, my wing divers!
1291;AG015BA;Fight starts now!
2281;AF013BD;They didn't even notice us. We're winning.
1606;AA081DB;I'm really good at flying at night.
1486;AF024BB;Still no signal to attack?
1520;AE051BC;Now, attack the arms!
1270;AR026BC;I WANT REVENGE!
4241;AA143BE;I used to be a port worker, and I used powered exoskeletons to carry cargo.
910;AA006CB;Wings, check.
749;AM171BA;I'm grateful!
966;AF012DA;This is the chance.
691;AM007BD;DON'T GIVE UP!
1396;AI022BC;No way I will die!
1758;AE113_015;Those civilians are trying to escape!
1471;AM120DC;Let's change the subject.
3502;AE184_002;The entire urban area is infested by Aranean nests!
1688;AA102BE;Tell my family I fought bravely.
1129;AA042DD;Didn't you sleep well?
3801;AE131_025;Do they want a hibernate? But they're extraterrestrial beings!
1398;AA008V;I'll meet you heroes!
1280;AH004DA;I'll go help the injured!
8308;AE205_034;Strike my ass our forces are scattered across the battlefield. God knows how many of them are still alive
1322;AA045DD;Did you call your family?
571;AO001Y;Reload!
3938;AEX04_309;Looks like a heavy armored teleportation ship. Stay on alert.
1767;AE004_004;INCOMING FLYING SAUCERS!
844;AL008AB;E.D.F.
598;AB009DD;AHHH!
1364;AF010Z;Wait for the attack signal.
4109;AA143BD;I used to be a port worker, and I used powered exoskeletons to carry cargo.
2410;AE002_136;Ready? I'm out-locking it now!
1938;AM176BB;I can't stand them, that's it.
1274;AG001BE;Looks like we're found!
6890;AU012Y;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
1176;AM022DD;That's amazing!
1652;AO008DD;Transfer power to weapons!
728;AY006BA;I'm in your debt.
7495;AU031BE;High up in the air our comrades fight, Dashing through the sky now like a million boats of light.
4498;AE181_017;Use the Barga against Oculus. Now, swing those arms and attack Oculus.
988;AL004DA;E-D-F!
2175;AEX04_010;Enemy confirmed! Up ahead!
1156;AA004CA;Wing drivers!
674;AL022AC;We killed them.
2370;AT104CA;I got caught in the web! Set me free!
1386;AM068BE;Let's talk about it later!
929;AC005BC;Enemy spotted!
1650;AE203_004;Aliens are being dropped!
620;AM060DB;Correct!
1613;AI001BE;Crap! My armor is...
3087;AT302DD;You're the one destroying the web for me? Thank you!
1861;AK003BD;The scout reports that the enemy is sighted.
1678;AE119_055;Don't get overwhelmed by the impact!
1651;AZ015G;Smoke grenades confirmed.
813;AM203BE;Is that so?
1639;AA026CB;Stay pretty during battle!
750;AM098DD;It's not!
1258;AF005BC;The enemy didn't see us.
1751;AA081BD;The enemy is hiding in the dark.
2849;AE186_026;The nest has been damaged! It's starting to tilt!
1861;AK015BA;Looks like our job's not finished yet!
1617;AM085DD;Stop the nonsense!
2216;AE176_057;No, it's completely useless!
2656;AE202_007;Rifles are no use! Use explosives!
1284;AO028BD;Swap the magazine!
1096;AE190_027;Starting Airaid!
993;AM032X;Got it, got it!
931;AEX04_196;Defend Borga!
596;AM048BA;Understood!
742;AY063DC;Forgive me.
853;AS003AA;Let me down!
3807;AE207_018;Damn it! Number 11 is dropping a teleportation anchor from the sky!
1638;AE141_112;Heard the report from Beijing?
1557;AR028BE;BIG BRO GOT CHEWED UP!
1734;AZ005J;This is Bummer. I'm back.
3830;AE176_009;AFV will join the battle today. That will be easier for us.
1673;AE129_062;IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, BACK OFF!
2595;AEX04_412;A little one! It's fast! Look out!
873;AN012AB;We'll fight with you.
2767;AI016DB;I'm sorry! I don't think I can make it back!
3958;AE210_066;Aim at the cannons! Destroy them first and wait for the right moment!
631;AG006BE;We're spotted!
1167;AE189_004;Attack those webs!
1062;AM119BE;Just you wait.
1999;AN001X;What are you doing here, civilian?
806;AM157DD;Do you mean it?
1107;AE129_014;Take out the monsters!
6072;AE113_032;The debris of the teleportation ship has been recovered. Maybe we can learn how to destroy the golden armor.
897;AY075BC;I'm having fun.
772;AA005AC;Watch your backs!
3589;AE194_022;Infantry, stay away from Barga, or you'll be crushed!
534;AM025DC;Okay.
5492;AE206_005;If we run, we get the same outcome. We either get hit in the face or in the back. That's the only difference.
912;AM189BE;This is for money.
2672;AA124BA;They shouldn't have run into us. Tough luck for them.
1098;AN020DB;All yours, Captain.
715;AC019AC;Plan B!
1670;AEX04_226;I can't see through the fog!
499;AQ002DC;UGH!
872;AP003CB;CONFIRMED HIT!
1361;AO018BE;Reload! Reload!
1140;AM131BE;Don't say it now!
1089;AM046V;What did you say?
1677;AA029AC;This is a battle we cannot lose!
1688;AE200_017;Let's head to the top of that mountain!
1750;AE052BD;ATTACK THE BODY!
685;AE181_014;Detach!
3067;AT305DC;You saved me, right? How should I thank you?
1125;AM066CB;THAT'S INSANE!
1282;AE038AA;Be careful on the right!
1803;AC014DA;Stabilizer! Up and running!
1524;AE001_042;You are a civilian, aren't you?
1013;AA003EC;SAVE ME
1339;AM006CB;Wingdiver pride!
7571;AU031AA;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1542;AE176_002;Can we not fight in this weather?
6157;AE005_025;SURVIVED?! We didn't even make a scratch! It wasn't immobilized either! It was just taking a goddamn nap!
3503;AE180_006;This is it for us, now enjoy our last ride!
1752;AB013BC;I told you I can't run anymore!
837;AQ008DA;The End
822;AZ010J;Target confirmed.
2585;AE176_042;Quick! Do something to fight against the flying type!
4233;AS001AB;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
957;AG013BD;Oh no!
1991;AD017DC;Come on! Get into range!
1536;AZ022H;FIRE ROCKET CANNON!
1908;AE021DD;The sky belongs to me!
2252;AQ004Z;BWAHHH!
1901;AI005BB;Ugh! The injury's nothing!
2237;AL002ZA;YEAH!
2865;AT307DA;You almost blew me away along with the web, be careful!
2098;AA060AA;Show them what a heavy gunfire is!
3756;AE130_027;We're under heavy fire! Our destruction is just a matter of time!
1964;AI005Y;How much death gratuity do we get paid?
953;AL023CA;Save the power!
2064;AB013BD;I told you I can't run anymore!
1402;AO005DC;Weapon power, link!
3797;AA001DB;I train harder than anyone else, so I will be fine. No doubt.
3716;AEX04_533;Monsters are being sent over! It's a teleportation device!
3274;AEX01_003;With their assistance, I'm certain we will get through this crisis.
1590;AE025BD;That's what I'm waiting for!
889;AG005CB;You're great!
1504;AA023CB;Don't lose to fencers!
629;AB006BA;GO!
2394;AC007CB;Use your own judgment to change to flying combat.
2247;AF009Z;Attack immediately when the signal is given.
1554;AA051BB;I'm the best singer!
1490;AE121_047;We're being attacked by the base!
1250;AZ012Q;Airdropping begins now!
1468;AF001BA;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
1830;AE020DA;Behold the dance of death!
1640;AN008BD;You're lucky. I'll help you.
2813;AA140BC;Because the powered exoskeletons were developed by the military.
1090;AH022BA;Our man is injured!
4958;AE144_014;Surface to air missiles and powered exoskeletons will cover you. Infantry unit, do not back down!
1630;AE153_048;We have confirmed landing ships.
1221;AM181BB;This is for honor.
1002;AM214BA;I can't believe it!
7631;AU121BA;Now pick up our weapons off we go Firing at the flying saucer shooting down our foe
812;AM036AA;Let me think about it.
664;AP001BA;We hit it!
2300;AA131BD;It's hard to control a powered exoskeleton.
1114;AN019BB;Let me join your team.
1496;AE211_020;How did it attack us?
1089;AE013DA;No problem!
979;AK002ZA;Check the sensor!
1015;AL014DA;Exterminated!
1074;AE179_032;Let's keep moving!
1216;AE010BA;I'M AIMING AT YOU!
1863;AA101BA;Really hate to step on the battlefield.
1226;AB012DD;Why keep running?
9086;AE147_027;These are pure killing machines. The previous drones are nothing like them. So this is the real power of the enemy.
4005;AA143BA;I used to be a port worker, and I used powered exoskeletons to carry cargo.
2858;AD019BC;Come here, I'll teach you a lesson!
1671;AE141_043;We destroyed the cannons!
3153;AE129_029;Demolition takes time! Take down the nearby enemies first!
1768;AA064DD;Why did you choose to fly?
648;AZ015O;Lock on!
1886;AR006BC;Captain! Please reply!
3514;AA108BA;I've always wanted to be a soldier. Now my dream comes true.
1718;AEX04_386;Monster incoming!
882;AN010AA;We will defend you.
730;AM142DB;That's fate.
1219;AL011AB;Enemies are wiped out!
1354;AN034BB;I know who you are.
3471;AT303DB;You destroyed the web! I'm alive all thanks to you!
3182;AEX04_470;God, it's huge! That thing is the king!
1590;AB014DA;I don't want to run anymore!
1078;AE196_007;Join the Fencer team!
741;AT112DB;Help!
625;AM013AC;You did it!
1812;AE177_013;I want a weapon like that too!
4288;AA095DD;Once you fly in the sky, you hear people applauding. I really missed that.
925;AC001Z;Prepare for battle!
2968;AN026BC;Without a commander, I am troubled.
1014;AH025BC;Are you alright, Captain?
1587;AC004DB;SENSOR IS DETECTING ENEMIES!
1300;AL031BB;We're a great team!
1035;AO008BD;I'm out of ammo!
2657;AJ010W;There must be a solution. Just think!
1805;AA073DA;So here we are, underground!
1320;AA009DB;The sky today is pretty.
2853;AA020V;Exercise your body, but exercise your mind more!
3592;AE145_014;Infantry unit! Leave the enemy to us! You just carry on!
1296;AE005AB;SHOOT THEM DEAD!
1254;AN035BA;I've heard everything about you.
1179;AM067DB;It's common sense.
1249;AE169_009;There are other monsters!
2897;AZ001M;Epimetheus surfaced. Ready to launch!
1229;AM094BB;You don't need to point it out.
2326;AE200_016;Go for the mountain top! Let's go!
2351;AL002BA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2237;AN007BD;A civilian? Then I can't leave you alone.
1107;AS004BC;STOP THAT!
1835;AE130_033;The main cannon is ineffective!
586;AE039BB;Sweet!
1614;AR006DA;REVENGE FOR THE CAPTAIN!
1146;AO007DD;Power reload!
877;AF012CA;Keep it cool.
844;AM169BA;Thank you, sir!
1065;AE054BB;Attacking now!
1166;AE024V;TAKE THIS!
1397;AE150_010;There are monsters in the dark!
1166;AT104DD;I can't get out!
711;AM006Z;You did it!
1245;AA004ED;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1082;AF012DC;This is the chance.
951;AY034BD;Sigh...
614;AM123DC;Thank you.
642;AM018DC;Nice!
881;AB005BE;I'll follow you!
1548;AE132_032;The cave has been secured!
3190;AA013BE;They must be surprised with Earthling's recklessness.
2293;AE110_011;This is Skybat, commence attack!
804;AG004DD;We're found!
917;AM004BB;I'll help you!
1241;AB006DA;Prepare to fly!
1579;AM026BD;How long have you been practicing?
798;AE118_008;What did you say?
886;AM097DD;You're wrong!
1420;AF013DA;Hush, they might find us.
898;AL017CB;Is it done?
2231;AL013X;These guys are really a pain in the ass!
1138;AD013AA;All ready to fire!
2033;AT309BA;Thanks to the hero that came to my rescue!
3184;AEX04_579;Ranger unit will arrive any second. They will provide fire support.
1455;AI021BD;It's just a scratch.
814;AM022BA;Genius
2837;AE116_023;Then we'll send your pets to hell!
4086;AE131_002;Great. Investigate the insides of the cave. Charge in.
773;AM053CB;Thank you!
2777;AA110BE;Being a soldier is awesome! You can get a pension!
2675;AE173_011;Numerous flying objects spotted in the sky!
1580;AM089BE;That's what the officer told us, too.
2080;AEX04_353;CONFIRMED! TELEPORTATION ANCHOR!
991;AR004W;Someone got hit!
964;AE180_024;We'll support you!
1207;AT203CA;Let's save the trapped ones!
1402;AN003BB;What are you doing, civilian?
2048;AEX04_483;Those guys in spacesuits are coming!
6025;AE176_046;Powered exoskeletons are arriving momentarily. Leave the flying types and the species gamma to powered exoskeletons.
1932;AF014AC;Don't shoot! On my command!
2863;AN036BC;You must be the ace. Nice to meet you.
1403;AE004_001;Is that the mothership?
1109;AS005AC;Take down this one!
1667;AR010BC;He was a great captain!
751;AH001DB;Watch out!
518;AM032Z;NO!
1746;AE045AA;Don't ever expect us to surrender!
439;AQ002ZA;AHHH!
1065;AC023DA;It'll begin soon.
5503;AE110_005;A troop of large flying saucers is about to fly over this area. Exterminate the monsters being deployed.
3146;AI016BC;Oh no! My eyes are blurry!
1824;AEX04_336;CONFIRMED! IMPERIAL DRONES!
1817;AF010DB;We'll be found if we get too close.
3463;AE150_024;This area is right on the projected path of the mysterious monster!
1579;AC020DA;I'll show you my techniques!
1793;AE107_043;Being a soldier is awesome!
607;AM016BC;Great!
958;AM054Y;Told you no!
1363;AR018BD;An ally got chewed up!
9037;AE150_041;We will call this creature Arcalus from now on. We have launched several large-scale attacks, but still failed to cause any critical damage to it.
1444;AE159_045;What a nightmare.
2086;AE176_069;We have a plan to defeat Arcalus.
1206;AM113BC;And you really think so?
2206;AE103_027;Aim at the upper part of the pylons!
3179;AR012BE;Our captain died! We need a replacement commander!
1321;AEX04_168;SECURE THIS BRIDGE!
1354;AE138_061;Victory is ours!
1984;AA085BC;I hate dark and narrow places.
4275;AE207_010;The storm unit is under attack! We... we have to do something about it!
4053;AE123_007;Civilians can evacuate themselves. Focus on killing the aliens!
1431;AM088DB;Are you stupid or what?
2050;AE002_117;Hey, wrong way! Over here!
5192;AEX04_395;HUH! MONSTERS INCOMING! IT'S THOSE... RED THINGS!
678;AY059DB;Pardon me.
1458;AF002DB;The enemy hasn't caught us.
811;AM043DD;No way!
1024;AY036DB;I can't believe it!
3104;AA022BD;I'm transferring to the Logistics Division tomorrow. Thanks.
1500;AE142_015;Let's retreat for now!
7586;AU111DD;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
2188;AN028DD;It's a dream to fight together with a hero!
2166;AE202_016;I can't get my head around it.
2218;AEX04_344;Confirmed! Alien in heavy armor!
1508;AA026AC;We are invincible soldiers!
1249;AR009DD;Isn't the captain here?
2216;AE130_025;The cannon at the base is attacking us!
2050;AE129_057;THE BASS! IT'S MOVING!
851;AL007DA;That's great!
2005;AE111_017;What the hell is the Air Force doing?!
2065;AE013AB;REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING! BE BRAVE!
1746;AA062AC;Don't lose to infantry, got that?
2042;AF016BE;Keep quiet, or the enemy will hear us.
1009;AM058DB;That makes sense.
1055;AB002BC;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
2640;AR003V;They killed one of us! REVENGE!
2279;AF015BE;I must move in carefully without being spotted.
961;AT105DC;I can't escape!
6788;AU112AC;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
1225;AT005DA;I'M PULLED IN!
1092;AC012BE;Ready to fight, aren't you?
3063;AA032BA;If I'd known this would happen, I would have done my training seriously.
1082;AE002_051;WE'RE SURROUNDED!
1402;AR037BC;Ray got shoot up!
670;AM013BE;You're great!
1654;AE149_013;Fireballs incoming!
2203;AI007DD;Stabilizer! Condition 4!
1589;AA023DA;Plasma Drive Output Stable
2620;AEX04_634;Fencer 1, Engaging the enemy!
1250;AO018BB;Reload! reload!
1329;AB003ZA;MOVE FORWARD!
3582;AZ040G;End of shooting. Stand by in the air. Ready for the next mission.
838;AY027BD;You're funny.
1734;AE170_033;Over here! The rail gun!
2184;AA031DB;Plasma drive, low output activated.
1334;AE109_012;There are more than we can manage!
1688;AE141_029;Destroy the cannons on the sides!
2309;AE145_040;First aliens and now a robot army?
1202;AG011AA;Seems like we're spotted!
3833;AE191_030;Destroy the teleportation devices and exterminate the monsters.
901;AM139BD;That's the rumor.
7610;AU021BA;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise
904;AL013CA;Neutralized!
997;AD021BE;I will show it to you!
1817;AA100DA;I'll never get defeated by monsters.
2751;AO019BC;The ammo doesn't come out! The gun's jammed!
691;AM039BA;Leave it to me.
7616;AU021CB;It's only with our sacrifice that mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1831;AE128_046;Airaid will launch momentarily.
2165;AEX04_600;Sniper Team has reached target point.
1154;AJ009W;Why would this happen?
2389;AE206_020;Gone won. How many of you are operational?
343;AM029BD;Got it.
1481;AE029V;JUST DISAPPEAR!
2336;AE178_015;A BUNCH OF ALIENS ARE COMING RIGHT AT US!
1061;AM152BC;Okay, okay!
2699;AE185_021;The monster... it...
1479;AE176_015;Whew! That was easy!
1358;AE025W;BE CAREFUL ON THE LEFT!
645;AM059CB;What the?
2895;AE159_026;That's not a mountain, it's a monster's nest!
525;AE166_026;Damn it!
1583;AE112_053;WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!
2369;AEX04_233;Oh no! The fog has cleared!
1302;AE002_109;We'll change route!
1587;AEX04_499;Imperial Drones!
581;AM117DB;Shut up!
586;AG012BE;Come here!
798;AM011V;Great work!
3890;AE002_155;The exit is not far. We'll be fine once we get back to the surface.
1314;AG006Z;Suppress the targets!
630;AY059DC;Pardon me.
1485;AE015X;Hey! Now!
826;AM076W;I'm in your debt!
1178;AP002BE;We took out the enemy!
528;AP005ZA;Got it.
1199;AE133_009;Aliens confirmed!
1520;AE120_003;Use silent modules!
647;AM121BB;WRONG!
961;AL039BB;Can I get a medal?
1265;AE144_019;Some of them are red!
2488;AEX04_150;Requested Epimetheus support. Missile incoming.
574;AM133DA;Thank you!
1304;AE159_057;Attack their nest!
2352;AA068AC;No infantry has such powerful fire ever!
1175;AM184BE;This is for my lover!
2443;AF010AB;Proceed carefully. Don't get caught by the enemy.
1029;AA045DB;Did you call your family?
1275;AE206_016;Too many drones!
1553;AT006DA;Get me out of the web!
1948;AC005DA;Enemies detected! Really close!
3285;AE129_054;We don't need the heavy tanks! We'll blow up this thing!
1393;AE157_015;Communication recovered!
4821;AE114_017;Infantry! Stay close to the AFVs! The cover fire will help us to move up!
1193;AS008BB;Help me!
995;AM002BE;Everything all right?
1662;AA042BE;Is there someone waiting for you at home?
1242;AL032DD;Time for a rest!
734;AM030DD;Understood.
854;AZ013Q;Ready to drop.
2231;AEX04_709;The support vehicles have arrived. Hold your ground.
1718;AE016BB;SWALLOW THIS!
1019;AG002BD;They found us!
2636;AI004BC;I can still fight. Ha!
2089;AE110_037;Guess we have to put our lives at risk for this one!
700;AE006DC;Attack!
1454;AC001W;Prepped and ready for battle!
866;AY018BC;Should be clear.
965;AS003FB;AHHH! NO!
5202;AE107_028;It's too difficult to destroy the large flying saucer, but at least you should wipe out the monsters.
1598;AN021BA;Hey, so nice to see you here!
2369;AE127_018;There are too many! We can't kill them all!
681;AQ007AB;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1649;AA011BE;Let's get serious today.
921;AE031BC;I'll take care of it!
1486;AE153_008;The enemy is scattered to the side!
1149;AE106_023;I'll do my best.
2158;AI020BC;I've seen worse, this is nothing!
2144;AE016AA;Keep shooting till all enemies are down!
1386;AL027BE;I took down the enemy!
1285;AM142BD;Can I call you teacher?
2480;AE002_088;Did that monster escape from a zoo or something?
1279;AE003BB;Here!
734;AB005CB;This way!
865;AM214BC;I can't believe it!
1012;AA004AC;Check your surroundings!
2154;AF003ZA;Move forward carefully. Don't get caught.
1526;AG002AC;Now! Kill them all!
2313;AE111_021;The city! Everyone's gonna die!
6789;AU122X;We shall allow these aliens, to rule we almost-abians.
935;AE147_014;They're attacking us!
2072;AE211_027;It regenerates lost limbs?
1247;AE005BB;GO TO HELL!
1548;AC007DA;The sensor has detected enemies!
1120;AD014BB;Still out of range.
2956;AE104_060;I need information. What are we fighting against?
10388;AE117_029;This mission is very dangerous, but if we don't step in, they will certainly become a terrible threat in the future. We must eliminate all monsters underground now.
1144;AE003_016;Die, you monster!
1569;AEX04_140;Initiating satellite attack!
3283;AE107_016;There are monsters dead ahead of us. Just my luck.
3570;AE120_002;The enemy did not see us. Get close and take them out at once!
1137;AY008DC;I'm so grateful!
3000;AE110_017;Damn! Our attacks were ineffective!
1818;AN021DC;I will be on your side all the time.
1218;AE002_021;They're attacking our men!
3966;AE141_035;Don't be afraid of the artillery strike! Just focus on destroying the cannons!
1833;AR039BD;I'm dead! My ally is dead!
893;AE139_010;It's nothin'!
2385;AE183_030;Good job, everyone! We're here to help!
514;AL009Y;Clear!
1683;AC017AB;We're in enemy's range. Already?
2933;AF007DB;Approaching target, don't get dragged into a tangled battle.
7594;AU031AC;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1415;AD018BA;Take them down when they get closer!
2645;AT108BC;I'M CUT IN THE WEB, RESCUE ME!
1601;AE184_004;Attack the Arrhenaeus!
907;AE001_021;MONSTERS!
1713;AE069BA;DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HUMANS!
1854;AE159_023;So many flying types!
754;AL016DA;We did it!
781;AM117BE;You mistook it.
1163;AM182BA;This is for my family.
1205;AO031BC;Swap the cartridge!
2733;AR043BC;Comrade, leave the rest to me!
1858;AE143_047;How's the secret weapon coming along?
1765;AA035AC;Even though it's painful, you fight!
2669;AE141_101;Operation in Beijing is about to begin.
521;AM020CA;Alright.
532;AY054BB;Good night.
880;AA067DA;What's your purpose?
538;AE005DB;Shoot!
2505;AO021BB;The magazine is empty! What should I do?
956;AS003V;OH NO!
1644;AM152DD;That's the kind of woman I am.
1169;AM024DB;You want me to praise you?
1107;AM042AB;I'll think about it!
4763;AE211_068;I'm afraid it wants to kill whoever destroyed the command ship.
2562;AE034BB;Dare to eat me? Bring it on!
1225;AE114_079;So have their feet!
1690;AE145_053;They sure don't look human to me!
3665;AE163_036;That's our only choice! There's nowhere for us to run now! Damn it!
1494;AE166_020;Their weapons look sharp!
3336;AF007DD;Approaching target! Don't get dragged into a tangled battle!
1296;AM010BE;DON'T BE DISCOURAGED!
1584;AB014DD;I don't want to run anymore!
2371;AEX04_246;Is it true that the monsters become slow at night?
1145;AE175_015;Queens defeated!
6828;AU022BB;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
1786;AJ001BC;We're all gonna die at this rate!
701;AQ002Y;AHHHH!
2784;AE034BA;Dare to eat me? Bring it on!
2339;AE197_010;MONSTERS! INCOMING!
2985;AZ031I;Well, do you think we missed the target?
2990;AA050DD;For a soldier, the most important thing is the brain.
1008;AY027DA;You're funny.
2782;AE103_046;There's too many of them! This base won't make it!
2603;AE140_034;We can't call the civilian newbie anymore!
2406;AE138_039;Good. Let the show begin.
2159;AE161_014;The teleportation ship is starting to move!
3336;AEX04_480;Those aliens are armed with new weapons. Don't underestimate them.
992;AM060X;Is that so?
2450;AE123_017;Three landing ships just entered the combat area!
1205;AL029BC;I killed the last one!
2394;AE148_005;Just right above us! SHITTY LUCK!
1520;AL030DB;My work is done.
812;AM062AA;Let me thank you.
861;AM148BC;It's possible!
2275;AE170_034;Damn it! What a piece of junk!
2352;AN032BC;I'm so happy that I can fight together with a hero!
3069;AEX02_024;We've been hit! We're going down! Brace yourselves!
870;AM017W;Sir, yes sir!
1825;AE062BE;I don't wanna die! Not now!
1062;AA035BC;Get fired up!
1946;AF030BB;Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.
1027;AE015DC;You can't hit me!
1736;AEX04_060;SHOT DOWN CONFIRMED!
2878;AE201_004;They've occupied the mountain! Don't let your guards down!
4568;AA018DD;I'm grateful that I've been able to fly in the sky every day since I became a soldier.
2292;AA026BB;Even in this situation, I feel hungry.
1936;AI002W;Ahh! My wound!
1602;AR017BE;IT LOOKS LIKE ONE MAN DIED!
767;AM007Y;I'm impressed!
3876;AE189_007;Let me down! Let me down now!
1870;AEX04_061;Destruction confirmed.
5503;AE202_061;So what? Why do we even need all those supplies? Haven't you noticed we're running short of personnel?
1680;AC007DC;Sensor has detected enemies!
1489;AE104_061;Hostile Forces.
1321;AF002AB;Be quiet or we'll be found.
8195;AE111_024;No one has had any success. The hull of the teleportation ship seems to be protected by some kind of barrier. We can't even make a scratch.
2589;AE002_171;Nothing to fear! Exterminate them all!
1098;AP024BB;Did I take it down?
600;AZ020PB;Launch!
5054;AE211_057;To be precise, it has the ability to transform thoughts into physical attacks.
819;AM043W;OKAY!
1592;AL044BC;I'm hurt. Can I go home?
865;AE007BE;Drop dead!
1172;AO009BE;THE BULLETS DON'T COME OUT!
1770;AF011BE;Now's the time for a surprise attack!
1944;AO006V;Cover me before I finish reloading!
1228;AE183_009;THEY'RE COMING!
529;AM030BC;Got it!
524;AM163BB;Thanks.
1567;AEX04_474;Aliens! Coming our way!
1439;AM003Z;Die a glorious death!
2651;AA071DB;Wingdivers are not suited for underground battles.
2103;AF018BC;If you fire, they will see us!
1517;AE177_045;Eliminate all enemies!
592;AY053DC;See ya.
2410;AE062BD;I don't want to die! Not now!
1793;AO012BD;Damn! My magazine is cracked!
1277;AQ010BC;The armor is broken!
2055;AEX02_002;Everyone back to base
790;AE012Y;Save me!
520;AM023X;Got it!
1753;AE180_016;It's unarmed because it's a crane.
711;AP001CA;It's a hit.
1468;AR007DA;I can't believe you were gone!
660;AE176_018;LET'S GO!
1407;AE163_007;Let's avenge our mates!
2434;AT001Y;It's pulling me in! It's too strong!
1375;AL028BE;The enemy is finished!
1394;AA058BB;Let's hang out tonight, everyone!
1119;AE156_011;The monsters are coming!
1099;AE206_015;Drones incoming!
3432;AE210_092;The command ship is being protected by some sort of forcefield!
1321;AL007Z;E-D-F!
1761;AL048BC;I'll receive more medals!
545;AEX04_137;Clear!
3334;AE199_005;The monsters! They're eating the buildings!
1437;AJ007DD;Continue the operation!
1110;AE026AC;LET'S TAKE IT DOWN!
1033;AN007DA;I'll follow your command.
1766;AE002_055;Calm down! Keep it together!
2249;AE211_082;Please don't do this, please!
1690;AC012BB;Ready to fight, aren't you?
6677;AU122W;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens
355;AM202BE;AH!
853;AM012AA;THAT'S GREAT!
1062;AE145_002;No need to spy on them?
2165;AE182_009;There are too many! We can't do it alone!
699;AD003AC;Ready weapon!
923;AA009AC;We won't lose!
950;AC001Y;It's about time.
2128;AN002W;Newcomer, don't let your guard down.
1890;AC015AA;Just a tiny mistake, you die.
4889;AE116_018;There are seven billion human fodders on Earth. The monsters will be well raised.
1488;AE150_038;Kill the remaining monsters!
1236;AF019DD;They haven't found us yet!
1235;AC006DC;The sensor is responding!
3203;AZ003L;Submarine aircraft carrier Epimetheus is surfacing.
1380;AA001BD;Show them our strength!
883;AI009BD;Support me!
622;AE026BA;NOW!
924;AL015CB;WE DID IT!
2328;AE166_032;Someone took out an oversized weapon!
1040;AM022DA;That's amazing!
1515;AA057BE;I'll give you something good later.
2570;AE176_073;But how do we get such a huge crane to hit it?
1870;AN004CB;Wingdivers will follow your command!
2040;AF008ZA;Don't panic and stay calm.
929;AE100_034;Huh? What happened?
553;AB016BB;RUN!
811;AA001Y;Am I dreaming?
1050;AM058AA;Check it again!
1271;AM156BA;We'll talk about it later!
1444;AEX04_494;RED COLOR DRONES!
1115;AL003BA;E.D.F.!
1640;AE182_006;We destroyed the big anchor!
992;AE118_016;We'll take care of it!
788;AM071AB;Are you sure?
2274;AL013AA;Report that we've eliminated enemies around!
369;AM055CA;Huh?
4070;AE107_036;Are these the monsters that were dropped before? Are they all lurking underground?
1364;AL005BE;YEAH!
2567;AE161_018;Teleportation ships are dropping down monsters!
1015;AP024BC;Did I take it down?
1674;AM146DA;Because I'm too poor to feed myself.
2553;AF007ZA;Get close enough and knock them down in one swoop!
1576;AE113_024;Did they just come from underground?
1398;AP016DB;Hit! Did you see that?
1738;AK002CB;The sensor is responding!
3859;AE198_039;RK8, my unit's making strange noises! Help me!
1530;AO008X;Watch me change the magazine!
1144;AE033AA;MORE TO THE LEFT!
1443;AH014BC;I'll check on your wound later.
950;AE044BB;Go for the left!
1471;AJ002DA;Send backup! Hurry!
3196;AE170_036;Thought I'd die here. Looks like I got lucky.
1326;AE146_037;Thank God you found us!
2312;AEX04_388;Look over there! Monsters!
2124;AI003ZA;Such wounds are nothing to a diver!
588;AZ006N;Fire!
806;AC003AC;Keep your guard up!
1822;AEX04_644;The Fencer team will be here any second.
1142;AL014BE;Neutralized!
1131;AM151BC;Agreed! Agreed!
3887;AE002_161;Hey, wait a minute. Are you saying that there will be more monsters?
1800;AE144_046;Mothership number eight is approaching.
555;AM032CB;NO!
1118;AT005AA;Target that thing!
2395;AE120_021;It's an honor to fight alongside the Spriggan.
2085;AN024DC;I'll protect you. That's my task.
2840;AZ011M;Was Epimetheus hacked? By whom?
1524;AF018BE;If you fire, they will see us.
4323;AEX04_407;Green monsters incoming! They attack in groups, and they're fast!
1415;AS013BB;Somebody help me!
2343;AN016AA;We're responsible for your safety. Let's move.
1225;AC018BE;I'm counting on you, partner.
8738;AE131_033;Photo analysis completed. This is a natural underground cave. We believe that the monsters entered the cave and expanded it to make the cave their nest.
699;AO001X;Reload!
1073;AY047DB;I'll fight with you.
1701;AF006W;Are we approaching the enemy like this?
2118;AT103AC;This is bad, at this rate!
2038;AL004BC;AHHHHHHH!!!!!
3723;AE143_052;We found the aliens' weak points after examining their bodies.
2253;AE202_026;You mean I can cancel out the greenhouse effect?
2202;AC005DD;Enemies detected! Really close!
1297;AO030BE;I'll change the cartridge!
657;AM015BE;Nice!
1603;AY057BD;When this is over, I'm out.
857;AH005BC;I'll protect you!
1154;AC014AC;The enemy is nearby!
978;AM104BD;That's what I heard!
916;AM015V;Just like that!
1622;AE050BE;NOW, ATTACK THE LEGS!
988;AE106_004;That's too risky!
853;AA001AA;Keep watch.
583;AP007BA;HIT!
1010;AG011AB;Seems that we're spotted.
1325;AE167_011;Big Anchor Confirmed!
1893;AE004_041;THEY'RE ATTACKING!
1255;AZ023O;BOLD SLAZER LAUNCH!
1902;AE005_028;Fire! Open fire!
1224;AM074DD;So I see.
3529;AEX04_683;This is Tag Team, Target Locked, Engaging Enemy!
1379;AN033BA;Can I have your autograph later?
1600;AD022DB;CONFIRMED DISTANCE WITH THE ENEMY!
1370;AE167_003;Teleportation Anchor!
4293;AE133_006;Water creates breeding conditions for any life form. Check out the area.
2669;AT010BE;DO SOMETHING TO TAKE DOWN THE THREAD SPINNING THING!
4476;AE106_013;They are machines anyway. Once we know their mechanics, we can deal with them.
1005;AM102DC;Now's not the time!
1492;AS004EC;LET'S GOOOO!
684;AL014CA;You did it!
756;AM167BC;I'm in your debt.
2331;AA016BC;I'm lucky, so I won't die here.
1550;AA062BE;Want to play a wordchain game?
692;AO014DD;Landing!
2018;AJ018BD;Over here! I'm over here!
1672;AE161_017;THEY'RE DROPPING OFF MONSTERS!
6900;AU122BB;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
1112;AA042X;It's not cold inside.
2779;AA002Y;We know nothing about our enemies, isn't that ridiculous?
1883;AA065BC;Why did you join the EDF?
1099;AE032AA;MORE TO THE RIGHT!
2449;AN026BB;Without a commander, I'm troubled.
955;AR001BB;CAPTAIN!
1288;AE173_021;Death Queen destroyed!
3338;AA142BC;I used private powered exoskeletons for cargo shipment before.
1149;AI009BE;Support me!
2122;AE012AB;Don't hesitate, just pull the trigger!
1333;AE150_043;All units, retreat!
1779;AA123BE;Let's scare the enemy to death!
1587;AE175_020;Queens, one left.
2713;AE190_049;We've our backs against the wall! Let's fight! Stop them!
1474;AM052W;You've got the wrong idea!
2324;AE176_077;All units retreat. Operation changed.
2170;AE001BE;WAHHHHH!
842;AL002CA;Yeah!
1686;AEX04_092;Eliminate enemy with our air raid.
1366;AA023CA;Don't lose, Defensers!
1245;AEX04_210;Bloody rain.
1805;AW002X;Oh my, I made it!
1068;AA047AC;Are you scared of the dark?
1905;AA057AC;Always check on your partner's positions.
4763;AE104_023;Not even the EDF can withstand them. Looks like this attack was well planned.
616;AM027DA;Yes, sir.
2789;AA093BE;Thinking that the enemy is in the dark makes me get cold feet.
1703;AN005CA;Our squad will be under your command.
3139;AZ018L;That request came from a civilian? How can that be?
1695;AE016X;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
4927;AE104_059;The estimated time of arrival is... wait, it can't be! It's already near ground level!
760;AY067DB;No problem.
628;AM034BE;Understood
2564;AE116_019;Doing as they please on someone else's planet.
2464;AE109_001;I'll take you to a safe place, this time for sure.
4192;AE175_006;Launch an airstrike to eliminate the enemy. Air raiders, identify target point.
2063;AI007AA;Ugh! It's no big deal.
1293;AE002_028;Let's finish our job!
1462;AA020CA;No one's afraid of heights.
1936;AM040DB;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
1636;AA025Z;Darkness is our world.
1385;AH022BC;Our man is injured!
1724;AR018DA;Ugh! Someone got chewed up!
817;AY052BD;Bye-bye.
6122;AE208_005;If that monster is from another planet, then this device is the door that connects our Earth with that planet.
1520;AS005FA;Set me free!
1527;AE001AA;RAWR!
1051;AA036AB;We can only move on!
578;AE112_042;Cover them!
2117;AM006AA;It's no big deal! Keep fighting!
1881;AE122_006;Make scrap metal out of them!
4601;AE186_008;Use the surface-to-air missiles mounted on powered exoskeletons to wipe out the flying type.
1309;AT202DC;Someone is stuck in the web!
4664;AE100_005;This base is too large for humans. It looks like it's designed for military vehicles.
3423;AE202_054;The whole world is joining forces to attack the mother ships.
1217;AR034BD;Okay, got you now!
6506;AE104_057;This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. The gigantic ship is descending. It might be heading to the combat area.
2984;AE003_014;Do you mean UFOs? That's ridiculous.
835;AE161_026;COMING AGAIN!
2178;AZ036J;What? You're a civilian?
1102;AN013BC;Please take me with you.
1080;AE031BA;I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT!
983;AM124DD;You saved me!
1069;AE002_165;I see.
4793;AE170_010;We can't destroy those drones' armor with our weapons. Let's use the railgun instead.
1659;AT007AB;Damn it! Let me go!
1597;AS001V;Yeaaaaahhhhhh!!!!
1827;AA032DB;Diagnostic system activated.
3990;AE114_003;Ground units! Attack the monsters! The Air Force will handle the mothership!
657;AL005DD;AHHH!
1256;AE137_006;Charge!
1293;AM055W;You must be wrong!
1057;AE002_095;The route is blocked!
1410;AE114_089;IT'S A WHOLE ARMY!
4191;AE115_008;Well, my class seems to be helpful. You are a good student.
1593;AE142_005;So they have reached Europe too?
1032;AM054DC;I can't do that!
2712;AF007V;Let's knock them down quick and clean once we're close enough.
2125;AZ029G;120mm cannon, fire!
655;AR002DC;CAPTAIN!
1512;AK005DB;The sensor has caught the enemy!
3136;AL028DC;Of course, I'm blessed by the Goddess of Victory.
7836;AU111AC;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters Crush them one by one
1945;AE175_013;WE HAVE CONFIRMED DEATH QUEEN!
1216;AE133_016;ACID RAIN!
978;AM050X;I heard that too!
3974;AE190_037;The aliens can regenerate themselves! THEY ARE INVINCIBLE!
504;AZ007M;Launch.
7785;AU121V;Now pick up our weapons off we go Firing at the flying saucers shooting down a foe
590;AO013DA;Landed!
6527;AE175_005;This is not going to be easy, but it's also a great opportunity to get all queens in one swoop. Eliminate them all!
1211;AE045BB;Attack your right!
1879;AT107DD;Stay away! It's a trap!
1066;AQ005DA;I got shot!
1852;AI008BB;Bring me the medicinal supply!
694;AY019BC;Hahaha
4934;AE202_062;Almost every major city has been destroyed by the Mother Ships.
1420;AE125_027;Support the units in combat.
883;AQ008BD;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1533;AL013Y;We did it! We won!
507;AE141_040;Good luck.
7634;AU161AC;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now Cause not a soul was spared
1488;AJ005DD;Where's the reinforcement?
1170;AE198_076;Detaching now!
3920;AE128_063;So, these bastards are turning Earth into a monster ranch?
852;AM074AA;Whoa!
607;AM033DB;Okay!
1021;AP004V;I DEFEATED IT!
2655;AE198_014;Argus the Battle? And there are eight of them!
726;AM023Z;Yeah, sure.
2092;AE210_107;Someone go back up Storm One! Hurry!
1259;AQ005FA;GAAAAH!!!
1456;AJ006DC;Report the casualties!
1809;AE179_015;We're gonna unlock the blast door!
7624;AU141BE;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my familiy are all gone
1960;AE194_009;The landing ship is deploying aliens!
1541;AE005_050;It curled into a ball!
2560;AN001AC;A civilian. Alright, I'll protect you.
1144;AE159_043;This is way too big!
1086;AK001DB;Enemy nearby!
964;AM121DB;I'm bored.
1322;AH021BD;WE HAVEN'T INJURED HERE!
1065;AI002BD;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1999;AT304DB;Awesome! You saved my life!
880;AA002AA;Stay alert!
864;AM039BC;Leave it to me.
1330;AG010BD;They're coming this way!
711;AM002V;Hang tight!
2220;AC013DD;Plasma Drive, output increases.
2654;AE004_045;The enemies are attacking from the sides!
4476;AA143BC;I used to be a port worker, and I used powered exoskeletons to carry cargo.
1258;AZ024O;BOLDS LASER, SHOOT!
1198;AA072BE;How is this happening?
2220;AI017DD;Today is really not my day!
3272;AE104_056;We're hit! Prepare for crash landing! HOLD TIGHT!
3743;AA132BC;But with a trained body and a powered exoskeleton, it's not a problem.
1377;AM135BE;Yeah, you can say that.
830;AP004BE;A clean hit!
1561;AI012DB;I won't be able to fight long!
2925;AT308BD;Thanks for saving me! Ah! It's you!
892;AM078AC;How can that be?
2934;AA020Y;I'd have taken some days off if I had known the aliens were coming.
401;AQ004BA;Ugh!
596;AM031AA;FINE!
813;AM013BA;You're great!
1230;AM005DD;I'll protect you all!
1023;AB002BB;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
1028;AL031BA;We're a great team!
2061;AR011BA;Captain! I won't forget you!
1483;AF019BA;Once you fire, they'll see us.
1733;AE025BB;That's what I'm waiting for!
1057;AI001W;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1827;AN008V;I trust you. I got your back.
1541;AE175_009;ALIENS SPARTAN!
721;AS004FB;STOP IT!
995;AL006ZA;AHHH!
6033;AE118_041;This is Dover Leader! I'm hit! SAVE ME!
1356;AB007BB;Hey! Time to move!
1075;AZ014PB;Output increased.
2044;AA004EE;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
2424;AE041BC;It's getting more interesting!
4102;AE114_081;They can recover fast, even during injury. Keep shooting till they're dead!
2011;AEX04_688;This is Tiger II, moving in!
1849;AEX04_182;Move in! Neutralize the enemy!
7668;AU111DA;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
1161;AD011AB;Don't shoot! Too far!
1853;AE178_009;Ugh, cut it out!
686;AM014BA;AMAZING!
3562;AE210_125;The central bottom of the command ship doesn't have any armour.
8828;AE202_055;We haven't found a way to destroy the mother ships yet, but even if we don't stand a chance, we will keep on the good fight. Nothing will change that.
1064;AY036BA;I can't believe it.
3945;AA018DB;I'm grateful that I've been able to fly in the sky every day since I became a soldier.
1190;AA039BE;Are you petrified?
1198;AE113_028;Well done, newbie!
2437;AM009DD;Endure the pain! Let's keep fighting!
904;AA069BC;Do you regret?
1394;AO006AB;Out of bullets! Reloading!
3085;AE171_042;We couldn't hurt it with air strikes and missiles at the time.
1336;AM004AC;STAY THERE! I'M COMING!
595;AY063BA;Forgive me.
2115;AR010AA;Drop those dead! Defeat the enemy!
1037;AH006DB;Are the wings all good?
1912;AE148_022;Dropping off from the sky!
898;AL017AC;Well done, guys.
1755;AF001DA;The enemy doesn't seem to notice us.
1464;AE026W;WATCH OUT FROM BEHIND!
801;AP012BE;IT'S FINISHED!
4847;AA020Z;As long as we fight to the last minute, we can make a change. Let's go!
3578;AM011DD;We must continue to fly until all enemies are knocked down!
1520;AL026CB;You're talented in flying.
5297;AE105_019;This is HQ. The flying saucers are dangerous. Permission to attack granted.
4788;AE114_045;That alien is a... a soldier? The alien infantry is here!
1388;AA068BA;Why'd you take a mission like this?
7597;AU031DD;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1994;AN001BD;Are you a civilian? I'll protect you.
2472;AE198_079;Select your targets! Fire at will!
1397;AE159_034;Move in towards the hilltop.
2256;AR038BA;My... My body is dead!
999;AT107AC;DESTROY THE WEB!
837;AE128_050;FIRE!
991;AE104_064;What is that?
2461;AE171_041;Surprisingly, it's still not defeated!
1863;AE138_025;The alien army is closing in!
1342;AY027BB;You're funny.
1875;AE197_011;Monsters everywhere!
440;AM037BC;Sure.
2341;AF031BC;The tension gives me the thrills!
1150;AL030BB;We're invincible!
1066;AP005W;Enemy defeated!
1058;AZ029I;The bombing is over!
1606;AQ012BD;I've been shot! Ugh!
624;AP012DD;Great!
1047;AT108DC;I'm caught on the web!
1676;AM143DD;Because I love the sky!
1765;AC020BB;Remember what I told you yesterday?
4660;AEX03_014;You fool! Don't turn your back on Araneas, or else their threads will get you!
2238;AM141DA;There's no other choices than fighting, am I wrong?
2382;AB001X;Whaaaaaa!!!
3041;AE155_024;Fire at that monster! That should cut off the threads!
587;AP001ZA;I got it!
1565;AT205DA;Our friend got stuck in the web!
2887;AQ005ZA;GAAAAAAAH!
1856;AE142_020;Hey dude, glad to see you!
1932;AE179_010;We're going to open the blast door!
1720;AEX04_211;Dammit, I'm soaking wet.
1123;AO011DB;Ready for cool down.
1059;AE132_009;DON'T FALL!
763;AE023AC;ARMSHOT!
765;AH002AA;HOLD ON!
778;AM154DD;Oh yeah?
1600;AT102DB;Ugh! It's a trap!
1490;AE119_039;THERE ARE TOO MANY ENEMIES!
1187;AI011BA;We need rescue!
1099;AL019X;Can I get a medal?
4678;AE143_039;This is Scout! Different types of monsters are coming out from those giant teleport anchors!
1854;AF003X;Let's kill them before they see us.
2070;AE141_007;The enemy's launching an onslaught!
2265;AE036BD;I'll make some juicy steak of you!
2701;AE158_031;They can attack from inside the barriers. Be careful!
796;AC008DA;It's our turn.
1523;AE177_035;Don't underestimate us!
2504;AE114_055;So they have their own language just like humans?
3537;AA022ZA;We're the only divers trained to fight underground. Let's go!
2001;AL010CA;EDF! EDF!
1511;AR022BC;This thing killed my buddy!
363;AE002DC;Yeah!
2627;AZ009O;What? A civilian? Are you kidding me?
746;AM104DD;Guess so!
1896;AA005EC;Someone! Save me!
3184;AF010CB;We are the Elite Unit. We should always keep calm.
1076;AE199_004;LOOK AT THAT BUILDING!
2197;AZ005I;After confirming the targets, we will start bombing.
1466;AD002BD;The enemy is closing in!
2413;AE131_058;It's good to hear that. You can leave the rest to us.
1393;AEX04_332;Confirmed! Aranea!
2505;AK005BC;Emergency contact! The enemy shows up!
776;AA003ZA;Eyes up!
3367;AE119_008;Look! There are monsters! The red ones!
3410;AA012DA;Although combat is tough, I really enjoy flying in the sky.
3837;AE198_017;Marga three charging forward. Ah!
1215;AE035AA;I'LL LEAVE THE LEFT TO YOU!
855;AB006BB;Go!
1295;AM010Y;I'd better bring my A-game!
1071;AE132_028;Very courageous!
1619;AE182_007;THERE'S MORE THAN ONE BIG ANCHOR!
1751;AEX04_690;This is Tiger Team, moving in!
5293;AE158_005;Airstrike in 3, 2, 1, Engaged.
1071;AP009AA;Who's next?
1509;AA027BB;I start to feel hungry.
2179;AF008V;Don't waste your shots, they will find us.
1114;AJ006BC;WE NEED RESCUE!
1247;AS005EB;SAVE ME!
1915;AK015BB;Looks like our job isn't finished yet!
1890;AE205_013;MONSTERS EVERYWHERE!
2517;AE194_007;Imperial drones incoming! This doesn't look good!
1133;AY020BB;Hahahaha!
811;AY027DC;You're funny.
881;AG003Y;They're coming at us!
1452;AE181_021;It's working! Keep attacking!
1949;AE184_015;Anchor has been successfully destroyed!
2697;AE143_059;In other words, it's the environment that killed them.
1534;AD006DC;Aski for permission to attack!
1401;AEX04_087;Entering combat area.
877;AL010Y;Neutralized!
2791;AI007AB;Oh, it's no big deal
4345;AE138_036;Grim Reaper has been sent to the combat area. Should arrive momentarily.
1456;AA049BA;I'm a gambling genius.
1837;AM176BC;I can't stand them. That's it.
1543;AE190_013;THE ALIENS ARE COMING!
1139;AE196_001;There are survivors!
2247;AE103_025;We must destroy the pylons! Attack!
1474;AE121_039;The cannons are activating!
900;AN012BC;I'll fight with you.
664;AY037DD;Hi!
1597;AA007DD;The wind is refreshing.
928;AC009BC;I can't die.
754;AA040BB;Are you shaking?
2264;AE162_024;Attack, Arcalus! Don't let it pass!
920;AS004DC;Stop it!
993;AO002X;Reloading ammo!
3022;AE104_069;It's not a terrorist attack, it's an alien invasion!
1213;AC024BE;It's party time!
1843;AE139_003;Well, let's get to work!
1647;AM176BD;I can't stand him. That's it.
1092;AE151_008;Enemy's over there!
1373;AA006DA;Flying is my job.
465;AY022DA;Heh heh!
1289;AJ006DB;Report the casualties!
3615;AA068AA;No infantry has such powerful fire, ever.
1662;AD016BA;Into the range, come on!
1880;AL019AA;Looks like they're eradicated completely.
697;AM031BC;Yes, sir!
960;AM066DC;That's what I was taught.
1489;AE177_003;Are we going back to that base?
480;AY054DC;Good night.
2307;AA016Y;I can't go on a trip, that's over the top!
1106;AG003BA;THE ENEMY IS MOVING!
1894;AA061AC;Show them the power of heavy weapons!
7325;AE198_013;It can be used for combat, but it was originally designed as a crane. The only upside is, it's very sturdy, so just fire away!
2607;AA105BA;I'd done the training for a guard, but not for a soldier.
2410;AE129_021;Do the aliens have control over the weather?
2338;AEX04_632;This is Spencer, we've reached combat area!
665;AM201BA;What?!
780;AG001DB;Incoming!
767;AM040AA;Stop it!
1652;AT108AB;Someone break the web!
573;AM034DC;Got it!
2342;AL001AC;H
2650;AE001_015;This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.
805;AM015DB;Well done!
1388;AE211_055;That's impossible!
2134;AT310DA;It's my privilege to be saved by you.
852;AP001X;That's a hit!
2229;AE200_019;Okay, let the wing divers take the lead.
933;AB003Y;Follow the Sergeant!
870;AM009BD;Don't move!
2893;AE003_047;All exterminated! It's finally over!
1646;AK006DD;The scout has spotted the enemy!
771;AE133_025;Move on.
2503;AE122_019;I SURVIVED BECAUSE OF YOU, CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH!
1115;AS005BE;HOLY-
6172;AE210_136;We will let the whole world know about this victory. Today, we sunk the enemy command ship.
1540;AA008BD;It's just fighting. Easy.
690;AO001CB;Charge!
1248;AL020Y;Pat on the back, please.
1231;AM101DD;Get your facts straight!
1525;AEX04_662;Spriggan unit, attack!
1623;AE198_078;All units ready for combat!
1396;AE153_042;Next three, got hit!
643;AZ022J;Fire!
1575;AE128_004;There's only room for one.
1177;AY013DD;I love you!
657;AM030DA;Understood.
2274;AA014BE;We don't accept immigrants on this planet.
3511;AZ022PB;This gun of light can eradicate everything, including gods!
1435;AE201_011;Winged Aliens, incoming!
2340;AA107BC;Because I left the security company to enlist.
950;AH006BA;I'll back you up!
338;AM030BA;Got it!
1462;AE002BE;AAAAAAPPPPPPP
6690;AU112Y;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
1508;AU002Y;On the web. Help!
1539;AY062BB;I shouldn't have done that.
1675;AJ011BE;Where's the replacement commander?
2001;AE131_055;There they are! The Vanguard!
1835;AL042BD;I... I'm alive!
1581;AA022V;Try to fight elegantly!
336;AM069AB;What?
1683;AR004V;Damn! Man down!
1049;AL017AA;Well done, guys!
3039;AE158_034;You really are a bunch of brave idiots.
1094;AE105_050;Wait, wait, WAIT!
2020;AE186_013;I'll shoot you down if you come close!
1706;AO006DD;Weapon system, reactivate!
1844;AE114_078;Their arms have regenerated!
578;AE211_025;Wonderful!
1903;AE198_019;Barga 5 here! Commence attack!
1273;AJ010DC;WE DON'T HAVE A COMMANDER!
1302;AL020X;Will we get a BONUS?
1329;AY009BA;Next time I'll save you.
1312;AD006CA;Attack the incoming enemy!
788;AM014BC;AMAZING!
3261;AT306BE;Did you destroy the web? Thank you for saving my life!
1680;AE005_009;Don't attack before we're close enough!
1064;AY076BD;We're partners, right?
1543;AA007BA;I never lose.
969;AM074BA;We can't afford that!
1281;AE017BE;I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD!
1762;AN013DD;Hi Captain! Nice to meet you!
1962;AE125_001;The enemy artillery unit is straight ahead!
4095;AA083DC;This operation. Is the Commander serious?
4011;AE190_039;Ranger 1-2 suffered heavy casualties. They've taken refuge in a building.
1261;AF006BD;The enemy's off guard.
1449;AA002DA;I'm better than anyone else!
972;AM173BA;You saved my life!
1507;AA001FA;AAAAAA
746;AZ025Q;There you go.
1993;AE139_026;All enemies are coming this way.
1277;AI002DD;Output is dropping?!
1962;AE175_017;Queens eliminated successfully!
2127;AE130_014;Infantry, move behind the heavy tanks!
1926;AT106CA;Don't save me! It's a trap!
888;AP005DA;Defeated it!
950;AE044BE;Go for the left!
1836;AE050BB;NOW! ATTACK THE LEGS!
1282;AG001V;NO! SHOOT!
1839;AEX04_651;Grim Reaper, engage the hostiles!
1516;AF026BA;How long before we can engage?
792;AQ006CB;I'M FALLING!
993;AE032BB;Great chance!
1035;AD003BD;INCOMING!
4177;AE140_010;Take a good look. The battle is lopsided. We might get wiped out too!
822;AP004BD;A clean hit.
1466;AH010BD;The medic will check on you later!
731;AA040DB;How's it going?
2671;AE140_006;What can you do to help when you're somewhere safe?
1285;AZ008H;Request received.
1645;AM150DC;Do you need any reasons to fly?
3375;AE207_006;This is the end. Don't die before I do.
933;AI007BB;Where's the medic?
722;AM011Y;Respect!
1533;AE114_001;Is that the mothership?
2825;AZ001QB;This is carrier noble, we've brought a new vehicle.
5080;AE178_038;It's really hard to aim at the enemies when there are a bunch of bastards bouncing around like bunnies!
799;AE190_048;Keep fighting!
1985;AY048BE;From now on, we are part of your unit.
1203;AM136BA;That's not so bad, right?
8876;AE106_006;This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. Flying saucers are unmanned drones, meaning that we can still defeat them, even if they outnumber us.
1373;AM187BC;This is freedom.
3290;AA017W;The commander of this area is superb, that's why we survived.
604;AM017CB;Approved.
2314;AE003W;HAAAAAA!!!
1009;AM029X;Sir, yes sir!
1178;AN003BE;What are you doing, civilian?
1598;AE200_021;Driver 2, attack!
5667;AE103_036;There's great confusion in the media right now, so keep it cool and don't start going around spreading rumors.
742;AQ012BB;I've been shot!
1610;AE118_026;Understood. Commence attack.
4433;AE105_076;Crap! I don't know who they are, but are they really going to start a war?
9082;AE116_031;This is a special news flash. The aliens dispatched infantry units to Europe, but the EDF was sent in to engage the enemy and secured a victory.
728;AH015BB;Are you shot?
837;AA037DB;Did you gain weight?
3651;AE147_016;Fire at the new type drones. We need to collect new data.
6753;AU022AC;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
835;AH018BD;Are you attacked?
5894;AE114_052;Permission to engage the aliens granted. Ground units, commence the attack on those aliens.
805;AS006AC;Oh no!
749;AM048DC;That won't work.
938;AE156_007;We need help here!
1715;AA060BA;This is not a game. You got that?
1466;AE211_122;Storm 2, moving in!
6859;AU112AA;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong.
660;AM072Y;I'm grateful.
2578;AE119_006;That's because you have no idea how to handle it.
817;AM031DA;Sir, yes sir!
362;AM052BA;Got it!
1713;AE156_009;Destroy the web to save those trapped!
1410;AR014DD;One diver died!
1891;AE064BA;WHY ISN'T IT DEAD YET?!
1179;AB004X;We've run too long!
3547;AT010BB;Do something to take down the thread-spitting thing!
1232;AE011DD;Can you keep up with me?
2818;AE002_174;This is the exit. We can meet up with our unit.
1663;AE163_023;Something is flying over there!
786;AI002Y;I'M WOUNDED!
1286;AH009AA;You'll make it, don't worry!
1100;AC002BE;I'll fight with you, Captain.
1208;AT301BB;Thanks for saving me!
1127;AK007AA;Keep your guard up!
2379;AA131BC;It's hard to control a powered exoskeleton.
591;AM023V;NO
1189;AM051W;Did you get something wrong?
3684;AE210_054;The command ship has much greater firepower than a mother ship.
1360;AM154BC;I have to believe that!
1145;AO002BC;Reloading ammo
2014;AE149_034;Destroyed Deroy B successfully!
1631;AA010DA;My body feels light today.
3642;AEX02_020;This is the rescue chopper. We are headed to the site to pick up the wounded.
5431;AE121_005;Planes can't approach. The enemy's counter air system is perfect. We should attack from the ground.
4450;AE114_018;It scares the hell out of me that this gigantic thing is above my head.
1577;AT204AA;Rescue those trapped by the net!
583;AH016BC;Are you hurt?
2536;AE155_008;On the web, they're trapped on the web!
2970;AE177_047;Heh, you ladies are really a piece of work.
420;AY026BE;Haha!
2027;AF013BE;They didn't even notice us. We're winning.
1537;AD011AA;Don't shoot! Too far!
2024;AL043BA;Can I be discharged after this mission?
3050;AE177_042;Shit! It appears they've taken the entire area!
2108;AE145_043;These guys are not robots!
761;AG006BB;We're spotted!
1868;AE146_023;Someone kill the aliens!
4097;AEX04_638;Fencer 8, we've found a unit in combat. Providing backup now.
1427;AL014BD;Neutralized
762;AD009DC;Ready to shoot!
3031;AA022X;I'm not doing this for justice. I had no choice.
1011;AL026BC;You did great, too!
566;AY044BB;Hello.
502;AB009DB;Yeah!
3169;AA005W;We've been dragged into an unprecedented major event.
1410;AZ033G;Vulcan Fire!
802;AM016BB;Great!
1439;AO004BD;I'll swap my magazines!
3256;AA001DA;I train harder than anyone else, so I'll be fine, no doubt!
1078;AY035BC;What a bummer.
1580;AE111_001;There are flying saucers everywhere!
3887;AA129BB;Only the powered exoskeletons can carry this heavy weapon!
1074;AA016AB;Focus on the mission.
7632;AU161AB;This city has nothing but despair. All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared.
492;AM038BB;Okay.
1594;AE111_005;We don't have any chance.
1637;AM009AC;Stop whining and start shooting!
2105;AC009DA;System normal. Ready to engage.
437;AM026DA;Got it.
2470;AF004V;The enemy is too careless. Let's move now!
1776;AA003EE;SAVE ME!
1062;AG002W;The enemy's moving!
1575;AR026BE;I WANT REVENGE!
1679;AL048BB;I'll receive more medals!
2527;AT206BA;Don't leave your men behind! Destroy the web!
873;AL006CA;Yeah!
7783;AU151BB;Abandoned by my friends and family, Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
1495;AR010DA;Huh? Captain!
2562;AA125BB;Poor enemy. They have to fight us.
2207;AL006AA;RAAAAAHHH!
1626;AC024BC;IT'S PARTY TIME!
3440;AE148_015;The legs aren't just for walking, but they're equipped with cannons too!
1237;AE128_057;DESTROY ALL ENEMIES!
1487;AB006Y;I'm okay! No problem!
534;AM163BE;Thanks!
2609;AE105_062;Very well. Attack the flying saucers!
1013;AE180_014;Approach the enemy!
1381;AE175_021;Death Queen defeated!
2092;AE155_020;Push forward! Make way ahead!
1787;AM084X;You expect me to say it's for the money?
4537;AE175_007;Transport aircrafts have arrived on the scene. We'll leave air raiders to indicate the drop point.
1528;AEX04_264;Confirmed. Monster.
1187;AG002V;OPEN FIRE!
1826;AE118_020;IT'S TOO BIG! WE CAN'T KILL IT!
1110;AY005DD;I'm in your debt.
1223;AM154BD;I have to believe that!
599;AY050DB;Goodbye!
1477;AM145BA;You read too many comic books.
1249;AA001BB;Show them our strength!
2504;AY012BE;Nothing to thank you for, I was fine by myself.
727;AM060BE;Impossible!
2815;AI004Z;Am I dying? It's not too bad.
1594;AE149_004;They are just standing still!
1233;AI013BD;The wound is hurting!
1001;AM159DD;No way!
1431;AA064AC;FENCES ARE INVINCIBLE!
2205;AE141_039;That's expected. Ready to strike.
1013;AM057AA;That's not true!
4586;AE211_053;Our scans show no traces of metal. It's power!
1207;AO005ZA;Transfer the power!
344;AM079BE;Yeah.
1913;AI004Y;Ah, just my luck!
1059;AY003DA;I want to thank you!
790;AA038Y;What's the purpose?
1047;AY061BC;I'll be more careful.
1645;AE166_034;Those are rocket launchers!
2438;AA134BC;Show them the strength of heavy firepower!
1540;AA046AB;Let's find our enemies in the dark!
1100;AN026DA;Don't worry, I'm here.
1072;AM136DA;Thank you so much!
668;AM112BE;You're wrong.
1555;AA093DC;I was an airshow performer.
1342;AE166_031;Blood 2 approaching.
950;AL013BC;Exterminated!
991;AE205_030;A new one?
6655;AE154_002;We have confirmed the mother monster is among the monsters. The aliens might plan to use the mother monster to multiply monsters.
1406;AH005AC;Be careful of the attacks!
1579;AY065BC;I will never do that again.
891;AL007DD;That's great!
1276;AI004AA;Prepare for the worst!
2001;AE198_025;Bargain 2, suffering damage!
940;AG002Z;INCOMING!
364;AM039AC;WAIT!
1185;AE039BD;Sweet!
1017;AE119_056;Beginning Air Raid.
885;AC003V;Keep your guard up!
1483;AS012BC;Let me down!
1958;AS009BA;Come over here! Save me!
866;AM189BD;This is for money.
2959;AT306BA;Did you destroy the web? Thank you for saving my life.
1152;AP008AC;Hit next!
7698;AU151V;Abandoned by my friends and family, alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
3963;AE199_020;Those mutants seem to feed on concrete and plastic in order to breed.
1298;AH003CB;Protect the injured!
2070;AR003ZA;I'm sorry. I couldn't protect you.
1107;AY033DB;I'm disappointed.
622;AM034AC;No, wait.
773;AM097DA;You're wrong!
1525;AE145_063;Ahhhhhhhhhh!
1555;AE002_084;How many monsters are there?
3275;AE118_001;Exterminate the monsters in this area. Commence operation.
1108;AR031BB;Joe got chewed up!
1640;AE141_076;Looks like they're clone soldiers!
893;AB004AA;FOLLOW ME!
1353;AT207DD;We have to save him!
1476;AE012CA;Use the power to attack!
915;AEX04_053;One remaining.
2083;AF004DD;Now's the best time to assault!
2215;AT203AC;Look at that web! People got caught!
1271;AQ005EE;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
2578;AE211_090;What? You're sending out civilians?
3958;AE191_013;Explore the underground and destroy each and every teleportation device.
509;AM029DD;Roger!
1509;AI022BB;No way I will die!
3937;AE150_005;It'll slightly increase our chances, and slightly is better than nothing.
4503;AE114_025;I'm not talking about monsters, I'm talking about humanoid aliens!
1122;AE026BD;NOOOOO!
826;AM095BD;That's right!
2311;AA031Y;I feel like I'm a hero. Let's do this!
5914;AE210_042;What? This wasn't mentioned in any of the reports. What the hell is happening?
1835;AI012DD;I won't be able to fight long!
3367;AZ028Q;This vehicle's in great condition. You should have no problems using it.
1828;AS016BC;Take down this guy!
2648;AA025AC;Exercise your body, but exercise your mind more.
1780;AA122BB;I can't wait to start the fight!
1782;AS013BD;Somebody help me!
732;AM078DB;I got that.
3805;AE121_026;This is Scout. We've confirmed aliens with monsters near the base!
2712;AT003BB;It's pulling me away! It's so strong!
970;AA042DA;Didn't you sleep well?
1145;AK004ZA;Prepare for battle!
517;AM209BE;AH!
1766;AEX04_184;Hold this position, and wait for backup!
2672;AA135BA;We're supermen when we're in powered exoskeletons!
1537;AE211_044;Is that its true power?
1000;AL005DC;Hahaha!
1330;AY077BD;Hey, we're buddies!
987;AB014BB;What's the rush?
1573;AK019BA;There seem to be more enemies!
602;AM036BB;Sound good.
872;AG002X;Bring it on!
1250;AY010BB;You're my hero.
1391;AN006CB;This team will protect you!
1101;AR034BA;Kenny got chewed up!
1040;AF014BD;I'll warm up first.
1681;AE138_006;WATCH OUT FOR THE CANNON!
1895;AA099DC;Flying in the sky is reassuring.
1346;AG010BC;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
879;AA076BE;Did you hear something?
917;AE211_138;We're counting on you.
957;AM167BA;I'm in your debt.
3024;AE143_057;Does it mean that the aliens have never faced air pollution before?
3122;AE150_042;We can't handle it with the current equipment! Retreat at once!
2356;AE104_062;What exactly does hostile forces mean?
1233;AE134_001;It's a large fleet.
1101;AE195_023;I knew you would come!
998;AL046BA;I SURVIVED!
1326;AT104DC;I can't get out!
2282;AE174_023;THE SHOTTER LEGGED ENEMY CONFIRMED!
513;AM070AC;Really?
1026;AN015BA;All yours, Captain.
2422;AE203_002;WE ARE SURROUNDED BY TELEPORTATION SHIPS!
857;AD004BE;Ready to shoot!
1777;AH006CB;Need a thorough check on the wings later!
2163;AT204BD;Don't give up! I'm coming to save you!
1366;AE003_038;There are so many!
789;AM204BA;Really?
1848;AD002DD;Beyond weapon effective range!
1674;AEX03_012;DESTROY THE TELEPORTATION ANCHOR!
1128;AEX04_641;Fencer, engage!
2438;AE197_014;Too many! What should we do?!
1308;AE145_027;Advance two blocks!
782;AY071BB;It happens.
3083;AE211_091;From now on, every human is an EDF soldier.
1848;AE145_050;Ugh, what are they?
756;AT112DA;Help!
3386;AE145_054;Aliens that don't look like humans. Hmm.
601;AEX04_191;Going up!
502;AM066BE;Forget it!
1794;AE176_005;There's no need for AFV to show up!
1120;AB003DA;YEAH!
1632;AE178_013;They're teleporting monsters!
1018;AY040BA;At your service.
1292;AD019BE;Come here, I'll teach you a lesson!
3690;AE139_024;We came on foot, and there are no getaway vehicles nearby.
12813;AE129_049;That base is surrounded by a golden armor. Even if we use CN explosives or the main cannons of heavy tanks, we can't guarantee that we can destroy the base. But the base must have a weakness. Please find that out.
1790;AR007DB;I can't believe you were gone!
1914;AR007DD;I can't believe you're gone!
2364;AA085DC;I so wanna go back outside
1878;AL002BC;EDF! EDF!
664;AA002AC;Stay alert.
6807;AE202_076;I understand. Right now, we all could use some... hope.
1029;AE021X;WATCH OUT BUDDY!
1621;AK019BB;There seems to be more enemies!
1521;AT204AC;Rescue those trapped by the net!
1620;AM114DD;You love daydreaming!
1259;AD010DD;Ready to take off!
2169;AF023BB;When the captain fires, we fire together.
908;AH017BC;Keep your cool.
634;AP004DB;Got it!
724;AM012BE;You're good!
1034;AL012BE;Mission Cleared!
2465;AE169_015;Successfully eliminated the giant monster!
1165;AI011DB;It hurts!
1873;AE120_016;They seem to be calling monsters over!
1935;AE137_017;The mobile base is coming towards us!
1717;AL008DD;AHHHHHHH!!!
1610;AE141_117;Doesn't sound fair, but I like it!
3490;AE184_013;Copy that, but we lack the firepower. This may not end well.
1752;AE166_035;Aliens have rocket launches!
468;AO001AB;Reload!
1865;AE165_007;Shoot down the teleportation ships!
895;AC004AA;Prepare for battle!
936;AF015CA;Don't waste bullets.
3236;AZ018K;This is Phobos, my job is done. Heading back now.
1533;AM094BE;You don't need to point it out.
1892;AA089BA;It's my first time in a cave like this.
2065;AE121_014;It's artillery fire from the base!
786;AM048W;You're wrong.
4146;AE138_044;They defeated powered exoskeletons with just infantry? Get outta here!
822;AG007X;We are found!
4263;AE129_008;The demolition team will proceed at your side. Keep going and take out the enemy.
3010;AE186_035;Look! Queens are here! Several of them!
7019;AE112_021;We have lost 20% of the total population in the past five months. Soon the human race will be facing extinction.
1826;AE195_018;We need to get the hell out of here!
6440;AE121_070;They'll be dominating the ground as long as the base exists. We've been outplayed.
1155;AE159_003;Team one, roger.
1014;AM098BB;THAT'S THE TRUTH!
1837;AN004BB;It's my duty to protect civilians.
4404;AE128_061;Those alien bastards look like they're afraid of water, but they aren't.
1867;AE125_015;Enemy landing ships confirmed!
1296;AK002CA;The sensor is responding!
1262;AE105_017;THEY'RE ATTACKING US!
2082;AE138_051;Now move quick! Head for the front and fire!
1062;AE003_001;There's the exit!
1365;AJ016BE;We need a captain!
496;AE202_058;Damn it!
4247;AE191_012;The enemy is teleporting monsters underground to multiply. Put an end to this!
1111;AP002BC;We took out the enemy!
1166;AB015BB;MOVE! MOVE!
1763;AE006_001;We've approached the mothership successfully!
2785;AE198_040;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3172;AE119_059;Easier for you now, isn't it? We'll leave the rest to you.
4135;AE113_044;A mothership has appeared in Europe. It silently hovers over a city.
2028;AE163_013;This operation is about to be over!
3146;AE156_004;These creatures are natural enemies of wing divers!
1589;AE149_015;Something is going on up there!
1402;AO029BA;CHANGE THE GUARD'S RIDGE!
1038;AA041DD;Are you shaking?
9105;AE164_003;They relied too much on aircraft. There's a huge technological gap between us and the enemy. We must use the element of surprise if we want to win.
676;AM083BD;I agree.
2107;AE179_022;They made it this deep inside!
1512;AA034DD;I'll cover you from the sky!
884;AM045X;I heard that too.
1335;AI002Z;I can see hell.
4279;AE210_096;I'm pulling every resource from the Intelligence Division to analyse the images.
3882;AE180_037;The transport aircraft is on its way. It will transport Barga by air.
2000;AA017X;I am lucky. I won't die.
1017;AM097BC;That is correct!
860;AM053BE;Leave it to me!
2485;AE153_035;The aliens are descending from the landing ships!
2204;AE210_020;Teleportation ship has been destroyed!
484;AQ006AA;Damn!
1397;AR032BB;George got chewed up!
3060;AE001_054;I can unlock the blast doors and then everyone can escape!
1918;AE142_036;There are monsters coming out of the holes!
544;AY066BD;My bad.
753;AM034AB;No, wait.
1356;AA057BB;I'll give you something good later.
2539;AE114_019;There's no way we can survive if it crashes down!
1035;AA035BB;Get fired up!
1227;AZ031H;You have to thank me!
2184;AA006V;We're strong! Believe in ourselves!
1294;AL035DB;I made it alive!
1716;AE171_032;It's here, again!
446;AM053X;What?!
1776;AE022X;Don't play dumb! Shoot!
5017;AE202_030;They are from outer space, after all. It's unlikely they brought submarines with them.
2155;AM005CB;We will die if we don't fight!
1087;AM038X;Certainly not!
945;AP005BA;BULL'S-EYE!
1473;AN023BE;You're lucky. I'll help you.
594;AA001AB;Keep watch.
1169;AR001BE;CAPTAIN!!!
1405;AH008DA;Report to the medical center!
1223;AE149_020;SHOOT HIM DOWN!
2082;AE103_035;A horde of UFOs were sighted too!
1029;AO007DB;Power reload!
2135;AE107_029;Take down the monsters! Advance!
2146;AM196BD;I did it after listening to others' opinions.
975;AY005DA;I'm in your debt!
1013;AM049BE;Sir, yes, sir!
713;AE023V;DIE!
2475;AE156_016;Break the web and save those who are captured!
1191;AE147_001;A mothership!
702;AE018Y;Engaging!
2497;AO021BC;The magazine is empty! What should I do?
1048;AY060DA;I apologize.
1363;AY010DD;You're my hero!
1378;AE198_085;But... the pilot!
899;AP019BA;How was that?
1590;AE060BC;Don't come! Stay away!
930;AM131DD;Thank you!
1041;AG006BD;WE'RE SPOTTED!
788;AL020BD;We did it!
1267;AEX04_205;Defend the Titan!
1128;AL008DC;AHHH!
2502;AE138_037;What? Aren't they the best of the best?
2397;AE127_016;I feel like I'm Napoleon Bonaparte.
1183;AE168_030;Kill Aranea!
1377;AE199_025;THAT BUILDING OVER THERE!
2529;AA128BC;How can we lose with such powerful heavy armaments?
1753;AE119_015;GET READY! HURRY!
1085;AF014BB;I'll warm up first.
1978;AA096DC;I have over 20 flying hours.
7818;AU171Y;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1243;AM126BC;DON'T GET IT WRONG!
1050;AL007BB;Hooray!
2963;AE127_038;Survivor confirmed! It's you again!
1792;AEX04_575;Ranger, neutralize the enemy.
1338;AC011BC;I will survive!
1267;AY004DB;I barely escaped.
693;AE149_031;Destroyed!
1436;AE140_028;I owe you twice now.
1234;AE061BC;Please hit the target!
2609;AE199_024;Attack those monsters! Let none of them escape!
1503;AE005_059;See you next time!
1598;AC023BE;Uh, are we going to fight?
707;AH001DD;Watch out!
884;AM039X;Can't be done!
2681;AE132_002;Let's clear the way with flame jets! Cover me!
1511;AE114_087;ENEMY SHIPS ARE LANDING!
2722;AEX04_451;Take them out before they get too close and kill us all!
1143;AE007X;Don't even try!
3489;AE198_069;Arcalis is a tough nut to crack. All units, cover Barca team.
1792;AEX04_098;Hooligan Cannon, open fire!
1227;AR035BD;Damn, got chewed up!
1586;AR004AB;Damn it! You killed my guys!
1806;AS002CB;AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
1291;AR007CB;Someone's down?
1544;AM068W;I'll let that one slide!
4630;AE195_002;Many teleportation anchors fell down into this area, and they're teleporting the monsters!
951;AZ013J;Target confirmed.
640;AH002BE;Dodge!
540;AM161BA;Thank you.
1383;AC018DD;Switch to active mode.
1450;AE112_002;I trust you have my back.
2402;AY011BB;EDF doesn't leave men behind. Ever.
1362;AE103_001;Was with that flying saucer.
1311;AL017BE;Go find other enemies!
2399;AZ001R;Impossible to offer artillery support now.
1535;AC012DD;Weapon system, activate!
2857;AY012BD;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
3972;AL006W;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2839;AZ006QB;This is Carrier. Civilian will drop off the vehicle.
1231;AG008BC;The enemy has seen us!
1329;AM071DC;You're absolutely right!
1898;AE029BC;Don't play dumb, shoot!
1520;AL034BC;I hope this is the final part.
2696;AN001CB;A civilian will protect you.
741;AM069W;Thank you, sir.
1511;AE207_014;Winged Alien's approaching!
1119;AM012CB;I'm impressed!
1367;AH024BC;Captain, please hold on!
1255;AL020DB;Switch to cruise mode.
980;AM026ZA;Sounds reasonable.
1336;AE118_004;Newbie, do your best.
1407;AB012BB;I'm tired already!
3618;AE123_009;Don't forget your mission! Wiping out the aliens is our priority!
4647;AE195_025;I'm not seeing things, am I? The reinforcement is really here!
817;AP022BB;H-HIT!
1048;AM109BC;Don't be stupid.
3626;AE135_028;We are not the best in dealing with fast opponents, but we have to do it.
6413;AE117_028;Assault team, move in and exterminate the monsters. The situation inside the cave is unclear, so be cautious.
1633;AL022CB;Activate the maintenance system.
1225;AY020BA;Ahahahaha!
770;AM072DC;That's right!
892;AE114_088;They've landed!
1142;AM132BE;Is that so?
6298;AE107_019;Although the species beta monsters are slow, they can unleash threads with acid, so they are very dangerous.
1445;AN022DC;I will follow your instruction.
1691;AE205_020;Spotted monsters in the sky!
1449;AI021BB;It's just a scratch!
954;AM100DD;You watch out!
1290;AL028BA;The enemy's finished!
679;AM002DA;You alright?
1148;AE014BC;TAKE THIS!
3356;AE002_102;I already have insomnia. Who's gonna pay if it gets worse?
1466;AA043BB;Do you think we will win?
2670;AA013BA;They must be surprised with Earthlings' recklessness.
2341;AE187_004;This is my hometown! Get the hell out!
1647;AM157BE;Let's talk about it next time!
611;AM024W;ROGER!
1048;AM164DA;What's going on?
1817;AE055BB;Attacking the enemy now!
1532;AM110DC;You're a genius.
2980;AE145_042;This city is about to be taken over by the robots!
2474;AA061BC;It's too dangerous. Do you still want to fight?
1272;AR024BD;Farewell, comrade!
1556;AN035BC;I've heard everything about you.
2145;AE176_020;Watch me blow those enemies away!
6787;AU162BC;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
3186;AE137_018;The enemy mobile base is coming. Watch out for motor strike.
2964;AE142_006;This is Scout, large group of monsters discovered.
7757;AU131V;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1757;AZ017O;Bulge laser, ready for launch.
2284;AF011DC;Let's sneak up on an unaware enemy and beat it!
2668;AE002_002;Monsters might be hiding out! Stay alert!
2745;AA139BA;It's my first time to use the military-powered exoskeleton.
4162;AE110_048;If you want to go home, then we have to take it back from those aliens!
2813;AS005BB;Holy fu-
1087;AF017AC;Check the equipment now!
4932;AE176_063;Fully charging it would deplete the power of an entire city, and that's the problem.
2741;AE169_010;There's more than one giant monster? Heck.
1838;AE135_014;Fire! Shoot them down!
1011;AY028DB;That's funny.
1086;AA074BE;Where's the enemy?
915;AM057DB;Just quit it!
1044;AEX04_337;Drones incoming!
3925;AE112_022;20%! That doesn't sound too bad.
1360;AE004_026;Fire! Fire!
2476;AF011BC;Now is the time for a surprise attack!
1055;AB012DA;Why keep running?
1702;AY009DD;Next time, I'll save you.
1520;AE166_043;Damn those aliens!
1438;AM149BD;That's probably the case.
863;AG013BC;Oh no!
1474;AEX04_183;Eliminate all enemy!
1817;AE126_018;Well done, newbie.
1756;AE022DD;I'M THE QUEEN OF THE SKY!
1945;AE005_010;So that's the mysterious monster?
440;AM040BA;Yes.
749;AM133DC;Thank you!
888;AM082BB;I think so too.
7785;AU151BC;Abandoned by my friends and family, Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
2146;AE141_106;HUMANS WON!
1936;AE114_068;AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
4624;AE109_034;There are no more comforting words I can say. I think you've already figured it out yourself.
1183;AY067DD;No problem!
3386;AE103_002;This is the Powered Exoskeleton Team, we're ready to engage!
1724;AEX04_290;CONFIRMED! LANDING SHIP!
1882;AA057DD;I don't dislike idiots.
2100;AE141_107;You heard that? We won!
996;AE018BA;I'LL BACK YOU UP!
1978;AE003BC;YEAH!
2132;AD017BB;Shoot them dead once they're in range!
1676;AE146_004;For how long should we keep hiding?
1752;AE110_033;At least take down the monsters!
1521;AM032DC;I swear in Wingdiver's name.
1817;AI007DA;Stabilizer! Condition 4!
2086;AE211_101;Look at that combat strength!
775;AM212BC;That can't be!
819;AE007CB;Evade!
1910;AL001BC;Aah!
3499;AE198_058;If we let those creatures enter the city, it'll be wiped out in no time!
2484;AE145_007;This is our best chance of shooting down the mothership!
2984;AE153_034;This is Scout. We have confirmed a landing ship fleet.
1964;AEX04_486;Heavy armored grace confirmed!
1385;AM091BA;It's also written in the books.
2403;AZ002PA;This is the trump card of humankind.
1328;AD002CA;Ready for flying combat!
780;AO007DC;Power reload!
1099;AJ007Y;Where are you, Sergeant?
2421;AE164_033;Aren't you scared? I'm scared to death.
2203;AEX04_224;The snow will impair your vision. Be careful.
1495;AC004BE;Please leave it to me next time.
1830;AN002AC;It's our duty to protect civilians.
5988;AE115_034;You survived. Looks like we two are bound by fate. Let's try making it through alive.
1853;AE158_038;All shield bearers are eliminated.
6775;AU152DC;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
2453;AC019DD;See if you can handle the attack from the sky!
2044;AE177_002;Not even close! Move!
457;AY053BB;See ya!
1113;AB003CB;MOVE FORWARD!
1904;AN005AC;Don't die on me. I'll protect you.
1607;AE198_065;Heavy armored aliens approaching!
1750;AA018ZA;Check the surroundings from above.
801;AE012DD;Lock on!
1457;AH011BB;We'll fix you up later!
1423;AA063DB;Why would people like you?
1126;AY010DB;You are my hero.
417;AQ001BA;GAH!
2669;AE162_026;Arkalis got hit! The attack seemed to work!
1501;AA001FD;AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
1186;AY008DA;I'm so grateful!
1267;AE021Z;Where's the enemy's commander?
1454;AE194_026;The mothership is rising!
931;AM130DD;I love you.
4944;AE135_016;Many soldiers were killed when these monsters were found in South America. We must be cautious.
640;AM016AC;Well done!
6629;AU132DC;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
1423;AJ012BC;Where's the new commander?
835;AN008CA;We'll protect you.
2358;AE168_033;The reinforcement will come soon. Hang in there!
495;AC011AB;Keep watch.
807;AM019X;Understood!
1904;AM146BC;You play too many video games.
2047;AM120BD;You'd better be sure before you say anything.
1495;AA017AB;Just focus on your duties.
2531;AE057BB;Spend your time on something more meaningful!
4489;AE110_028;If we can't find a way to penetrate the golden armor, mankind is lost.
600;AM034BB;Understood.
2702;AE131_032;We've gone so deep, but we can't see the end.
1653;AC009CA;Plasma Drive, full output!
782;AE027BC;Bring it!
905;AM104BA;That's what I heard!
842;AM018W;Leave it to me.
1631;AE145_072;THEY'RE COMING FROM THE SIDES!
3432;AA067AC;Our weapons rival to Panzers! There's nothing to be afraid of!
933;AD003Z;Raise your weapon!
1536;AE138_004;All units, attack!
1829;AE137_021;Do not attack the mobile base.
667;AP002AB;We got one!
1398;AQ015BE;GAAAAAAHHH!
650;AP002ZA;Impact!
1015;AE181_028;Leave it to us!
2008;AEX04_362;CONFIRMED! SHORT TYPE DEROY!
3019;AE104_063;Huh? Sergeant! This is not good!
848;AP009DD;One down!
813;AG013BB;Oh no!
4553;AE184_018;Aliens are deploying anchors in inhabited areas. They must be watching us.
1980;AT205AC;Destroy the nest! Save our men!
1154;AE037AA;LOOK AROUND CAREFULLY!
1153;AN020DC;All yours, Captain.
839;AEX04_065;Target down!
1748;AEX04_028;Enemy spotted from the rear!
1690;AC010DD;I will take down the enemies!
1650;AM166BE;Anything you want, my treat.
1913;AE156_015;Groups of monsters are approaching!
660;AE177_009;BEHIND
1477;AE175_018;Queens, three left.
753;AP023BB;We did it!
1554;AE146_034;Quiet, or they'll find us!
1734;AM144BE;Was it in your dreams?
356;AM030Y;Got it!
1211;AE015Y;Someone give me a hand!
4288;AE190_043;I'M HERE!! AAAAAAAAGGHH!!!
726;AM070DC;EXACTLY!
1818;AEX04_012;Enemy also behind us!
1041;AP004X;Target down!
673;AT001AB;HA!
2541;AC010AC;The enemy's around. The battle will soon begin.
878;AM031Z;You think so?
692;AE171_002;ADVANCE!
1087;AM094DA;Wrong from the start.
1409;AE145_026;Advance two blocks!
3394;AE205_006;This is Storm Four, call back the rescue team. We don't need it.
1099;AN013BB;Please take me with you!
1135;AM019W;No problem!
1836;AT103CB;This is the enemy's trap!
817;AY010BE;You're my hero!
1672;AM091BC;It's also written in the books.
2902;AEX04_619;This is Wing Diver, engaging hostiles.
2820;AA016DC;I think this equipment is best for fighting monsters.
1133;AM073BC;NOT POSSIBLE!
1728;AR007AB;Hey! You dead?
2050;AR002ZA;MAKE THE ENEMY PAY WITH BLOOD!
1128;AS006FA;Help!
821;AM205BB;Seriously?
476;AM033AA;NO
2646;AA031DD;Plasma Drive, low output activated.
1248;AE168_026;Destroy Aranea!
751;AA007AB;Clear the mission!
3849;AE118_022;Citizens are in danger. You have to stall the enemy before the tanks arrive.
2778;AL001X;AHHHHhhh
1595;AM037Z;I'll pay you back for sure!
3370;AE183_008;They aren't the brightest bunch. Simple-minded beasts.
6629;AU112BE;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
1913;AEX04_444;Flying types incoming! Shoot them down!
1413;AM080W;In order to become a General!
3035;AE121_016;Powered exoskeletons, move out! Cover the infantry!
796;AC005BE;Enemy spotted.
946;AM122BC;That's not true!
3284;AEX04_238;The sandstorm is blocking my vision!
1076;AA045DA;Did you call your family?
2290;AA005BE;It's going to be another real battle today.
1993;AE160_016;Confirmed to be enemy's landing ship.
1808;AO017BA;BULLETS! BULLETS!
7592;AU171BE;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1607;AE168_004;To fly in this fog.
1051;AK007DA;There's something coming!
1543;AS002X;WHAAAAA!
961;AEX04_080;Target hit!
3186;AA020BD;I've managed to survive this long, how can I die now?
1720;AN030DA;You are really famous!
1113;AP004W;DESTROYED!
1208;AE198_060;ENEMIES TO OUR LEFT!
4388;AA026V;If both soldiers and civilians are in danger, I would rather stand up and fight!
4612;AE005_031;Adjust the azimuth! Lock on target! Increase power output!
855;AM049Y;Don't think so.
3544;AA139BE;It's my first time to use the military-powered exoskeleton.
1136;AM181BD;This is for honor.
1226;AM008BE;Rescue is on the way!
3718;AE136_004;Finish urgent us with air strikes. EMC stand by just in case.
1665;AD005BD;Shoot them once they're in range!
1861;AN001DA;A civilian? I must protect him.
606;AE210_119;This...
1533;AE141_115;NEW WEAPONS RULE!
931;AN016DC;All yours.
2138;AE170_022;The whole unit was torn apart!
1731;AT103BE;Set me free! Set me free!
1839;AE041BB;IT'S GETTING MORE INTERESTING!
2687;AEX04_647;This is Grim Reaper. We've captured the prey.
3459;AE004_076;These guys are trained! They're Alien Special Forces!
2358;AE116_017;Are they trying to turn Earth into a ranch?!
3486;AA012DB;Although combat is tough, I really enjoy flying in the sky.
2430;AE123_011;Damn, is it an air maneuver operation?
1599;AE175_023;Annihilate all flying type!
478;AY002BD;Thank you.
769;AM056BB;Yes!
1883;AE103_020;This is more than an act of terrorism!
1144;AL020DC;Switch to cruise mode.
1753;AEX04_291;CONFIRMED! BATTLE ROBOT!
3457;AE138_030;Drones detected on the radar. They're approaching the combat area.
2740;AE199_014;The monsters are eating the buildings!
1678;AC015BC;Looks like the fight will be violent.
1428;AB012BC;I'm tired already.
980;AL007DC;That's great!
7599;AU161DA;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
753;AA005AB;Watch your backs.
1814;AE033BE;I'M ADVINCIBLE!
1223;AM077BE;That's why we're in trouble!
1143;AA001X;What's that about?
369;AM043BB;Got it!
681;AM059DD;That's right!
1470;AA030DA;Cruise mode sustained.
2187;AL027DD;Is that all you've got? Too weak.
525;AM037DD;Roger!
2721;AE144_030;We have confirmed a pack of the flying types. Be alert.
595;AM130DA;I love you.
7334;AE150_037;Don't get distracted by the mysterious monster. Let's follow our original plan. Eliminate the teleportation ships and the monsters.
5233;AE106_032;We did an amazing job. If we can analyse the data, we might be able to change the tide.
7726;AU021CA;It's only with thou sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1292;AE159_063;Just my luck.
1098;AY007DC;I owe you big.
1652;AEX04_700;Railgun team has arrived!
2160;AL002AA;EDF! EDF!
981;AT001CA;Unable to fly!
1389;AE202_028;How are the other areas looking?
1151;AF004Z;We're not yet spotted.
2833;AE121_034;Which means areas surrounding the base are suppressed.
3368;AE208_007;All fighting units, attack the gigantic teleportation anchor!
831;AM008W;AMAZING!
7752;AE131_037;They can only nest in natural caves and need help from the aliens. That means they don't have a strong ability to reproduce.
2526;AA068AB;No infantry has such powerful fire, ever!
1306;AI001X;I'm going to heaven.
1253;AM008V;Cover the injured!
1963;AS001CB;NOOOOOO!!!!
1277;AE008DA;Leave this one to me!
676;AM121BE;WRONG!
940;AP005BE;Bullseye!
1073;AM036X;That's impossible!
3247;AT111DA;I'm stuck in the web! Request for backup!
2322;AE036BB;I'll make some juicy steak out of you!
1107;AY075DA;I'm having fun!
1352;AJ009DB;We must complete the mission!
1174;AL031BE;We're a great team!
1617;AE163_012;Only a few aliens left!
1271;AE184_005;BE CAREFUL OF THOSE WEBS!
1958;AA023Y;The military isn't as good as I imagined.
631;AI002BB;I've been shot.
1567;AEX04_525;Monsters are being dropped!
1277;AE117_019;Aliens
2217;AE130_015;Heavy tanks, protect the infantry!
1534;AE168_011;I can see nothing in the fog!
2170;AE170_013;Let's see if there are trucks left along the road.
1621;AL042BE;I... I'm alive!
700;AM041AA;NEXT TIME!
4771;AE003_040;Monsters plus UFOs crap the most disgusting combo
2640;AE126_001;A large number of monsters confirmed. Stay alert.
2022;AF008CA;Don't shoot. On my command.
2116;AA010V;Exterminate the enemy, get it?
727;AE156_013;Monsters
1539;AE204_018;The aliens are up to something!
517;AM160DB;WHAT?!
960;AB005BB;I'LL FOLLOW YOU!
1005;AE109_020;RED MONSTERS!
1769;AA051AA;Let's enjoy the cave exploration!
2113;AE106_011;Use this method well and you can win!
1398;AM089DC;Do you have a screw loose?
7694;AU171DC;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1521;AN012V;You'll make it, I'm sure.
1452;AM092DC;Better keep it to yourself.
2571;AE003_027;Infantry! Protect the powered exoskeleton!
1081;AA006CA;Wings, check.
2824;AEX04_250;The drones are still spying on us, even after nightfall.
2867;AE114_059;Hold your ground! No way we're handing over this city!
628;AM059BE;No way!
1512;AE038BE;IT'S SHOWTIME!
706;AO001DB;Charge!
1148;AL011W;Exterminated!
1108;AM074X;I appreciate it.
952;AO009AB;I'M OUT OF AMMO!
1568;AE131_056;Looks like we made it in time!
2086;AI014BC;I'll be in trouble if I don't figure it out.
1639;AR006DD;Revenge for the captain!
1745;AE150_031;We don't have enough firepower!
347;AQ007BE;CRAP
1317;AM138BE;That is also possible.
1559;AEX04_039;Three more aliens out there!
680;AY019DB;Hahaha!
3867;AA019DC;It's safe in the sky. There are monsters everywhere on the ground.
2927;AE144_033;There comes a large group of the flying type, a lot of them!
1034;AN019DA;Take me with you.
524;AQ003AA;Ugh!
908;AN020BC;Aye, Captain.
574;AQ001Y;DAH!
3156;AEX02_019;The Earth will be destroyed while you rest.
43186;AEX02_036;Attention everyone. This is the EDF chief commander Humanity is facing grave challenges The primer attack shows no signs of slowing down Our homeland is being taken away from us and we have no chance of taking it back But I'll say despair is not an option The only path laid out before us is to fight until the end No matter how harsh the situation no one will overcome us and we will stand united The day we give up is the day humanity will cease to exist as long as we are alive EDF will continue the fight
2994;AM011DC;We must continue to fly until all enemies are knocked down!
2031;AF015DC;Do not fire before the captain gives the order.
1442;AD021DD;Confirmed shooting range!
1738;AE128_009;The enemy has started attacking!
2134;AEX04_689;This is Tiger III, moving in.
869;AY023DB;Heh.
1026;AT110DD;BREAK THE WEB!
1225;AEX04_231;The fog has cleared.
1180;AEX04_047;One enemy left!
1545;AN002DB;Looks like I can't leave him alone.
871;AM215BD;WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
6646;AU022BA;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
2165;AEX04_616;This is Wingdiver. We've reached target point.
3167;AE110_010;Hell no! I don't want to die by friendly fire!
1050;AM004CB;Don't hold back!
1158;AY006DD;I owe you one.
1531;AA028DB;Aurora Steyr, cut.
6552;AU112X;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
694;AC018AC;PLANET!
2187;AI005W;Take the condolence payment to my family.
1506;AA018BB;Bullets can never hit me.
1794;AM150DB;Do you need any reasons to fly?
1315;AE002_006;Try to hold it together.
1299;AE125_026;Alpha has arrived!
1633;AH010BE;The medic will check on you later!
1295;AEX03_016;Neutralize all threats!
1538;AN025BD;So you're my boss?
951;AP017BE;We did it!
1102;AM071BC;THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
1042;AR011AC;Forget about the dead!
740;AY054BD;Good night.
1195;AE016W;SHOOT AT THE RIGHT!
3272;AE121_025;Contact! Aliens are bringing in the monsters!
560;AM065AA;Thank you.
1378;AA036DC;Will return alive.
2277;AE015AA;Relax! I'll bring you back safe!
660;AQ003FC;Ugh!
711;AM015BC;Nice!
1189;AR021BB;Someone got killed!
581;AM048AC;That's right!
488;AM099BA;Agreed!
8099;AE001_002;Our job today is to direct traffic. You see, today is open house, and we're expecting a lot of visitors. It's gonna be a busy day.
1873;AE041BE;It's getting more interesting!
1346;AEX04_254;Stars are beautiful.
1983;AZ009PA;Tell me the enemy's coordinates!
1717;AE141_067;We've damaged the base successfully.
2227;AA003CB;We are the fastest soldiers!
7446;AE199_036;They are leaving no traces behind. They will destroy the human civilization and create a world without us.
3441;AE163_046;What a disgusting group. Let's annihilate them completely!
3112;AE211_061;Are we talking about a godlike entity?
4639;AE138_020;Infantry unit hide behind the Titans their unbreakable fortresses
2694;AL002V;E.D.F.! E.D.F.!
1666;AE159_047;Team 3, moving towards the peak.
2423;AE113_013;For a new recruit, you handle yourself pretty good.
3050;AEX02_004;I'll teach you greenhorns how to fight! Watch and learn!
2748;AZ029J;Air raid to the target site succeeded. How's the result?
1966;AE129_031;The sandstorm is about to subside!
1185;AG008BE;The enemy has seen us!
1873;AO006CB;Weapon system, reactivate!
2180;AEX04_496;RED COLOR DRONES, INCOMING!
2598;AA087BB;I don't want to fight those things in a place like this.
1032;AE141_105;Bravo!
2820;AT004DB;The web is... Request for backup!
2800;AZ015Q;Target coordinates confirmed. We'll drop from right above.
9725;AE146_053;We have to attack what's inside the spacesuit in order to defeat the aliens. Attacking the spacesuit itself is useless if we don't concentrate our attacks on a single spot.
2579;AA100BC;I'm unlucky. I will certainly...
2003;AQ005FD;AAAHHH!!
1930;AR018DD;Ah! Someone got chewed up!
7751;AU141BA;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
2959;AE117_023;They're making the monsters build a nest!
1670;AE002_162;Sergeant you are okay
2659;AE186_042;IT'S OVER! ATTACK FAILED!
1307;AL002DD;YEAH!
8167;AE113_034;Don't underestimate the enemy. We only jeopardized their plan A. I'm sure they'll start the next wave of attack.
818;AC004AB;Prepare for battle!
1448;AR002AC;HOW DARE YOU SHOOT MY MEN!
1174;AF011CB;Stay calm.
1697;AM080X;No particular reasons.
2757;AE130_005;The powered exoskeleton was crushed like a bug!
2746;AA024BA;I've got some juicy steak. I'll cook some tomorrow.
842;AM204BB;Really?
1852;AA099BC;If only I could make it back alive.
840;AG008DC;They found us!
1696;AE166_013;We have confirmed the landing ships!
1649;AC002W;The battle will begin shortly.
915;AH005BA;I'LL PROTECT YOU!
1055;AC003CB;Prepare for battle!
535;AG003CA;Attack!
1826;AE123_022;Our opponents are carrying firearms!
1359;AM082DD;It's not like that!
1806;AM177BA;Because all I know is fight!
3590;AA113BA;I heard about the war situation. EDF has a commanding lead.
2254;AE152_008;Concentrate your fire on the same spot!
672;AB001V;Onward!
589;AM027DB;Yes, sir.
1089;AK017BA;This is hopeless!
2390;AI003BD;It's no good if the situation goes on like this!
2092;AL017X;Okay, let's call it a day.
3604;AT307BC;EDF doesn't leave men behind, but I still want to thank you.
1470;AA061DA;Why would you become a pilot?
3104;AE119_054;Ground units, sorry to keep you waiting. We are here to support you.
1330;AT006AA;GET THOSE THREADS OFF ME!
1741;AE022BB;You shall not pass!
1037;AK003CB;Something's there!
6774;AU152DB;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
1638;AE169_001;LET'S GO ELIMINATE THE ENEMIES!
2653;AA002BA;This is why I became a soldier. Leave it to me.
804;AG006V;We're spotted!
1267;AE210_094;Stop it!
3622;AE146_020;If it goes on like this, we'll be wiped out! Permission to retreat!
1730;AE131_001;We have arrived at the destination!
4459;AA143BB;I used to be a port worker, and I used powered exoskeletons to carry cargo.
1954;AM146BB;You play too many video games.
1471;AL034DD;I'm going home to sleep.
777;AE122_012;KEEP FIGHTING!
1048;AJ004BE;What should we do now?
3264;AT307BD;EDF doesn't leave men behind, but I still want to thank you.
2124;AW002Y;I barely escaped. I'm in your debt.
304;AQ001EC;Ugh!
4410;AE001_045;We don't know what they are and how many there are, and we don't know how they got to the underground.
1078;AE190_004;Tanks! Move out!
3756;AE178_040;We'll change your gorilla code name to Storm from now on.
1445;AE006_013;Attack the flying saucers!
1604;AE147_024;The new-type drones have been dispatched!
2581;AE192_009;Those monsters have invaded the combat areas!
1638;AA057BC;I'll give you something good later.
1939;AE035BA;I'LL MAKE YOU A SIDE DISH!
751;AP011DA;We did it!
1019;AM023AB;That's amazing!
3089;AE123_026;Some civilians are trying to negotiate with the aliens.
602;AJ017BA;Come here!
586;AY037BA;Hi!
521;AY053BC;See ya!
3979;AZ042Q;A civilian? Why would he know about the military's transport request code?
1345;AF024BD;Still no signal to attack?
2466;AE130_002;It has legs, and it's chasing us!
985;AR019BC;One man down!
3601;AE004_034;They look just like us! The resemblance is unbelievable!
2157;AN009CA;Don't get mistaken! I'm only doing my job.
1134;AF012DD;This is the chance!
1408;AK001ZA;Those things are nearby!
1649;AG002DB;Let the flying combat begin!
1433;AS013BA;SOMEBODY HELP ME!
3376;AA118BE;I became a soldier only for the pension, I regret it now.
2671;AN004DC;You're a brave civilian. I'll protect you.
941;AO001DD;Charge!
496;AA038BA;Cover me!
1826;AO011BB;Not good! I'm out of ammo!
3102;AE113_043;I don't think the Air Force is capable of taking down ten of them.
2177;AA003W;I thought that I could handle any situations.
1480;AA059DA;Why did you join the EDF?
2739;AA055BC;I'll buy you a nice meal if we come back alive.
2041;AO023BB;Reloading is easy peasy!
2032;AA056BE;I'll treat you to a thickly cut steak.
2570;AE180_020;Lean your upper body forward, then take a swing.
1339;AL016AC;That seems to be the last one.
538;AM154DA;Oh yeah?
1540;AE153_017;ENEMIES LANDING SHIPS!
1429;AA080DB;Watch out for the altitude!
1248;AE126_014;Destroy the pylons!
3071;AE150_032;Damn! If only I had a blazer in my hand!
1323;AO006BD;Reloading! Back me up!
898;AM039Z;Are you sure?
583;AM042BA;No problem.
2719;AE144_001;Flying-type monsters are approaching. Prepare to fight.
5006;AE178_031;Air Force's attack is over. The remaining teleportation ships will be handled by the ground forces.
1622;AA003Z;Watch out on your left and right!
2640;AT008BD;IT USES ITS THREAD TO CAPTURE ITS PRAY TO EAT!
6402;AU142X;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1346;AE123_021;No time for chit-chat!
5223;AE159_068;The nest is oversized and hard to destroy. We will come up with a plan to get rid of it.
1939;AE162_014;It's our turn to take care of the rest.
6956;AE106_024;I don't know who our enemies are, but there is no doubt that they are powerful, and they plan to kill us all and destroy everything!
1296;AJ009BB;Let's stay here and fight!
15252;AE123_024;We have overcome the barriers of culture, language, and skin color to build the society we have today. Now it is time to overcome the barriers between planets. We have learned from our history that nothing is impossible.
679;AM045BE;Yes, sir!
1038;AJ002X;What should we do?
1456;AT201BA;Oh no, someone's caught!
1398;AL025BD;It was the last one, right?
2606;AEX04_646;Grim Reaper here. We've confirmed our prey.
1273;AR035BE;Damn, got chewed up!
2351;AA134BD;Show him the strength of heavy firepower!
3485;AE146_002;They're coming! Hush! We're doomed if they find us!
1953;AA002EC;AHH!!!
799;AM212BA;That can't be!
2300;AN003AB;Don't mess around, civilian. Leave it to us.
867;AL017DA;That's great!
3103;AE206_025;Infantry unit, powered exoskeletons here for support.
1737;AE048BC;Now, attack its right side!
1364;AM136BC;That's not so bad, right?
1888;AL019AC;Looks like they're eradicated completely.
1812;AE069BC;DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HUMANS!
1565;AL035BD;It's harder than imagined.
884;AE211_022;Direct hit!
908;AY029BE;Hee hee hee hee hee!
1063;AE147_013;WHAT'S THAT?!
4527;AE103_011;The pylon came from the sky! That means the monsters also came from the sky!
687;AQ004DB;I'm hit!
1038;AM067DA;It's common sense!
963;AM119BA;Just you wait.
1496;AM193BB;I've always wanted to do so.
2959;AA012CB;You should rely on your own judgment when in a dogfight.
4240;AE005_008;EMC is short range. So get close to the target now before it's too late.
733;AM112BC;You're wrong.
1522;AR030BC;The prince got shooed up!
1388;AC018DB;Switch to active mode.
3247;AA026Z;Don't be scared of the dark, we are grim reapers.
1395;AE131_031;Where does this cave lead to?
1105;AE145_062;FROM THE LEFT!
943;AK004CA;Enemy detected!
2524;AE192_013;The eggs are cracking, they're coming out!
2337;AZ012L;Launch tube closed! Submerge at once!
1266;AP002BB;We took out the enemy!
904;AY072BB;We'll figure it out.
2963;AE195_019;A rescue team has been dispatched! Hold it together!
2321;AE138_038;This is Grim Reaper, Targets confirmed!
1253;AR010DD;Huh?! CAPTAIN!
1429;AEX04_082;Air raid will begin shortly.
7475;AU011BD;We are the valiant infantry we are the alpha team with passion and camaraderie
465;AM060DA;Correct.
1593;AJ015BE;Someone give us instructions!
2317;AA071DC;Wingdivers are not suited for underground battles.
780;AY058BD;I'm sorry.
1667;AE145_044;There are aliens inside!
2089;AE146_011;Look at the powerful weapons they've got!
1063;AE118_018;IT'S TOO BIG!
1848;AM127BC;Look carefully, you're wrong!
842;AY047BB;I'll fight with you.
446;AQ003BE;Ah!
652;AQ013BD;I've been hit!
3836;AE150_014;I'm sorry. We failed Operation Mysterious Monster.
3022;AE116_030;HE'S THE ALIENS! WITH MONSTERS!
1661;AE125_004;Artillery unit confirmed!
1112;AM040X;THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
1616;AJ002BD;The situation is terrible!
1447;AR003AC;Damn! Man down!
3624;AE142_004;It's species beta! They're spitting threads!
1344;AT204DD;Someone got stuck!
1425;AP004AC;So that, direct hit!
2597;AA110BA;Being a soldier is awesome. You can get a pension.
539;AM125DA;Thank you.
4341;AQ006W;Mwahhh!
3518;AE118_039;New tanks have arrived! Infantry! Use the tanks as your cover!
1429;AN033BC;Can I have your autograph later?
7607;AU121AA;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucers, shooting down our flow
4182;AE112_018;As long as the teleportation ships exist, the war situation won't change.
570;AY025BC;Ha!
1392;AM148DB;I want to be an idol.
737;AZ006M;Launch Ready!
4865;AE114_024;What the hell? We've been fighting those outer space monsters all this time and it just came to you?
6899;AU132AA;Please don't send us on these grave missions, we're done with these expeditions!
1420;AM102BC;That's what we were taught!
1227;AM173BB;You saved my life!
630;AY051DB;Later.
1022;AE127_023;Watch your back!
3109;AE127_010;Snipers are the most fearsome enemies on the battlefield, get it?
1151;AK011BE;Are there more enemies?
7748;AU141V;Farewell my comrades, the time has come. It's over now, my love and my familia are all gone.
5095;AE112_031;A hatch opens up when the monsters are being dropped. We can shoot right into the open hatch from the ground.
1190;AR032BD;George got chewed up!
1196;AO016BD;WHERE ARE MY BULLETS?!
723;AH004Z;HOLD ON!
1775;AE002BC;WOAH!
1732;AO023BA;Reloading is easy peasy!
1864;AM089BC;That's what the officer told us, too.
1033;AM107DA;That would be nice.
1119;AM153BD;Oh, is that right?
683;AM008CB;Good job!
2044;AE202_005;Every attack is useless against them!
1518;AH009DA;We have to protect the injured!
1078;AEX04_536;IT'S URGINOUS!
4044;AE202_040;Sentinel-2, please respond! Report base status! Hello!
1252;AF018DB;Why don't we just shoot them dead?
678;AY039BE;All yours.
4302;AE168_035;The fog becomes dense, then clears up. Seize those right moments to attack!
1562;AE141_030;Destroy the cannons on the back!
1056;AM003BE;I'm coming to help!
7874;AE157_022;The shield bearers are not armed, so they pose no threat by themselves. Nevertheless, they function as bunkers to protect the aliens.
1942;AE119_018;This is Cold 2, ready for battle!
2776;AEX04_086;Air raid completed. Continue operation.
1042;AE110_002;Exterminate them!
2212;AT104DB;Ugh! I can't get out!
1172;AR035BB;Dan got chewed up!
4128;AZ006G;DE-202 to ground units, please designate attack targets.
1431;AF009BB;Captain, let's attack now!
1629;AE003_004;Wha... What's going on?
1742;AE160_012;Quiet! They'll find us!
962;AM035Z;I owe you one.
2016;AZ025O;Beaming complete. Cooling down the cannon.
903;AT101BB;SAVE ME!
1001;AK001DA;Enemy nearby!
2874;AEX04_590;We're in position! Rocket launchers ready!
1858;AC016AC;We're in the combat zone. Watch out!
2458;AA053AC;Take it easy. Your eyes will get used to the dark.
1451;AE123_002;IT'S A LANDING SHIP!
7619;AU131AC;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
845;AM167BB;I'm in your debt.
581;AM014Y;Yes sir!
787;AM062AC;Let me thank you.
1431;AE015Z;Tear the enemy apart!
1733;AM085X;It's not something I want to get into.
466;AL012DC;Clear!
1472;AF018DA;Why don't we just shoot them dead?
987;AE038AC;Be careful on the right!
2052;AE147_012;Something is coming out from the mothership!
24959;AE202_056;This is the chief commander of the EDF. I am running our military operations in a very secure hideout, but it seems the enemy has found us nonetheless. Rest assured, a new commander will be taking over the mission. The fight will not cease. Let's get those aliens off our planet! I'm counting on you! Over!
785;AM166DD;What happened?
1063;AE006Y;Don't look down on me!
878;AA007ZA;Come with me!
2105;AE163_025;What on earth are those?
672;AM018CB;Very well.
4096;AE211_089;Not all. We've given underground resistance the green light to attack.
909;AM133BB;Yeah, maybe.
1596;AEX04_320;CONFIRMED! SPECIES! GAMMA!
2328;AR039BA;I'm dead! My ally is dead!
1370;AH009BE;HOLD ON BUDDY!
1720;AA068BC;Why did you take a mission like this?
1058;AL019CA;Cool down the system!
2213;AL002BB;E.D.F! E.D.F!
3493;AE170_003;Dude, you always show up at the most crucial moment.
2297;AK013DB;Detected a reaction? What's this?
1214;AE028BC;Watch out, buddy!
3454;AE130_038;All units, focus on attacking the enemies rather than the base.
1975;AF004AC;We can get close to the enemy without notice.
6778;AU162DB;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
952;AI002BE;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
865;AH006BC;I'll back you up!
2671;AE103_017;Not only casualties, the whole city will be gone!
2239;AEX04_481;Aliens in space suits!
6835;AE002_147;Can somebody answer me? We are fighting the monsters underground, calling in for backup. It's no use.
967;AG001Y;The enemy saw us!
2126;AA026BC;Even in this situation, I feel hungry.
2898;AE143_025;Be thankful that it's not crashing onto your head!
731;AM025X;Yes sir!
1850;AE037BD;Happy birthday!
851;AA076BB;Did you hear something?
2447;AL002BE;EDF! EDF!
3428;AE166_041;If more of them keep coming, we'll be annihilated soon.
790;AA069BB;Do you regret?
2371;AA006X;Wait till this is over, I'm gonna feast.
1901;AEX04_516;There are teleportation anchors!
2658;AA033AA;If this operation succeeds, we can change the result.
1795;AEX04_017;Enemy found on the left side!
3489;AZ013N;This is barren land. We strongly believe that we will win.
7696;AU031CA;High up in the air, our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
938;AE153_014;Try again!
1452;AE141_047;This should do the job.
6023;AEX02_032;Because they are colonizing us. If there are more of them, we will become the indigenous peoples.
7737;AU151BE;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
7609;AU031DB;High up in the air, our comrades fight Dashing through the sky, not like a million bolts of light
985;AP023BD;WE DID IT!
2557;AE108_018;This is just... Unbelievable!
5239;AE204_011;Where to? The city has been destroyed! It's just a matter of time before they get to our base!
1476;AA005DA;I'll fly higher next time.
2768;AE160_018;Ugh, I'm sleepy...
1196;AR009AC;Defend those down!
1317;AE002_128;Keep moving forward!
2211;AF021BE;If you get too close, the enemy will notice you.
2189;AE014V;Watch out for enemies sneaking to the back!
3695;AE168_015;We've got better visibility now. Let's eliminate those monsters now!
2141;AE117_048;There's a cave leading further inside!
3941;AE211_099;That's God's true form.
1905;AE198_070;It's... it's Oculus!
1080;AC001DA;Go, go!
2360;AT004DC;The web is... request for backup!
778;AE024AC;LEG SHOT!
1136;AI006CA;Ah! My wounds!
2102;AE103_019;What in the world are we fighting against?
4052;AE160_019;Landing ship spotted up high!
1121;AY036BC;I can't believe it.
1985;AE171_013;GX3, ready to fire!
1178;AE130_012;GET BEHIND THE TITAN!
1861;AE048BD;Now! Attack its right side!
3982;AA132BB;But with a trained body and a powered exoskeleton, it's not a problem.
3654;AE121_044;These are plasma cannons. Can't believe they have that kind of technology.
2153;AD007AC;Hold your fire until they get in range!
1316;AT005BA;DAMN THOSE THREADS!
1492;AO030BD;I'LL CHANGE THE CARTRAGE!
1619;AA005EA;Someone save me!
1876;AE153_030;Reinforcements arrived!
1266;AT005BB;DAMN THOSE THREADS!
1335;AM129BB;Confirm once again!
2257;AO025BD;Reload! I'm so good at this!
1179;AM001X;You can't die!
1157;AH019BD;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
1358;AE127_019;There are more than expected!
1308;AR020BC;An ally is down!
1337;AM071BD;That's impossible!
616;AE114_048;Back up!
1098;AY017BC;Easy peasy.
1066;AF006BA;The enemy is off guard!
1828;AI001BC;Oh crap, my armor is...
1367;AI013BC;The wound is hurting!
946;AE002_065;Leave it to me!
2807;AL011DC;E-D-F!
1772;AE172_002;They've created a fortress!
1052;AM023BD;Master!
2830;AE004_042;The enemies are hiding in the shadows of buildings!
1655;AA004EB;I don't wanna die!
1442;AE011BA;Die, you monster!
1156;AL031DB;I'll take a rest.
1612;AQ007DD;AHHHHHHH!
6883;AU122DD;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
1413;AA006BE;We must take them down!
1210;AO022BD;Is the gun jammed?
487;AQ003W;UGH
1030;AL035DC;I made it alive.
943;AF009DC;Haven't been seen yet.
1571;AE002_099;There are just way too many!
1213;AE128_053;ME MOVE BEHIND US!
1494;AO023BE;Reloading is easy peasy!
949;AE005_003;MOVE FORWARD!
2755;AE141_009;We're under heavy fire! Will we make it through?
656;AL016BC;We won!
526;AM037DA;Roger!
1360;AI003DC;Fail to increase output!
3190;AA035W;Everybody died! This is not my plan!
1310;AT009BD;I can't get away!
1480;AM087DC;You sure your eyes are okay?
2092;AE127_017;Like his victory in the Battle of Austerlitz!
601;AM083BB;I agree.
541;AE211_079;What?!
2308;AE181_006;Enemy ahead! Continue the operation!
2348;AO024BB;Watch closely at how I swap the magazine!
1640;AEX04_072;Air Force dispatched, be careful!
1994;AE111_029;Perhaps, but it will take some time.
2956;AA011AB;EDF doesn't leave men behind, ever. You got that?
3208;AE145_033;It's robots! The robots are coming down!
1709;AB004BD;FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN!
785;AE004AA;Fire!
1556;AF006AA;The enemy can't catch us!
2295;AR039BC;I'm dead! My ally is dead!
396;AM210BD;Oh.
2899;AD012CB;Wait until the target is in range before you attack!
923;AA036BD;Do your best.
921;AM002BB;Everything all right!
1425;AN033BE;Can I have your autograph later?
478;AM084BA;Agreed.
1192;AM083DA;You're completely wrong.
694;AY063DA;Forgive me.
2616;AE114_076;I can't believe it! Their wounds are healing!
797;AM169BC;Thank you, sir!
1110;AM132DD;You saved me!
657;AH013BB;Is it bad?
1379;AC006CB;Maximize sensor output.
1426;AE206_012;But there's no one left!
1098;AT201DC;Allies got stuck!
4254;AE110_003;Leave the large flying saucers to the Air Force. Defeat the monsters on the ground.
3124;AE066BD;WAHAHAHAHAAAAA
1778;AC015BD;Looks like the fight will be violent.
1187;AD016DD;Can I pull the trigger?
2921;AA065DA;This job is dangerous. What keeps you from leaving?
805;AC001BE;Ready for battle!
839;AE104_058;What did you say?
838;AE179_053;Is it broken?
2558;AE198_068;Barga Team, Arcalis incoming! Engage now!
3794;AE208_002;These are super-sized teleportation anchors that came out of number 11.
2069;AE181_025;Monsters have entered the combat area!
2493;AA028Y;This is our planet. I will never give it away.
652;AM044BC;GOT IT!
1670;AA081BE;The enemy is hiding in the dark.
1636;AR001V;You alright? Get up!
2118;AE019AA;Show them the power of EDS!
2708;AE104_014;The city will be doomed if we don't destroy the pylons!
866;AC024DD;Let's go!
1774;AF019BB;Once you fire, they'll see us.
1498;AA047DC;There is someone I'm interested in.
822;AR016BD;One dead!
2783;AT302DB;You're the one destroying the web for me? Thank you.
1278;AA097BA;I wanna go home.
1909;AD007DA;Asking permission for flying combat!
6581;AU142CA;Here still I will fight the endless scream There is no one home to wait for me
1407;AA066DB;What are the reasons exactly?
1096;AO022BA;IS THE GUY JAMMED?!
1641;AA046AA;Let's find our enemies in the dark.
1285;AA084DA;I hate dark places!
6082;AE105_041;Ordinary terrorists can't possibly create such weapons. The enemy seems to be a powerful country.
1565;AK003DB;Let's check the enemy from above!
1258;AE013X;Swallow this!
1295;AM151BA;Agreed! Agreed!
713;AM014AB;AMAZING!
958;AM064BD;Not possible!
637;AH016BE;ARE YOU HURT?!
2012;AR013DD;Report! One diver fell!
1289;AK016BA;The job will never end!
1044;AZ016PA;Shooting mode!
1552;AA009CB;What a beautiful sky.
2113;AE211_128;Storm One, I'll cover you.
450;AM032BA;YES
2060;AZ009G;Come on, civilian! Tell me where to attack!
1659;AL033BD;We took down ALL enemies!
1285;AEX04_414;A NEW VARIANT!
4378;AE163_029;Hey look! Those are aliens! Aliens with wings are drawing close!
1458;AD007CA;Maximize the power output!
1915;AT203AB;Look at that web! People got caught!
2041;AI014BB;I'll be in trouble if I don't figure it out!
841;AE186_047;Keep attacking!
1440;AM091BE;It's also written in the books.
927;AY076BE;We're partners, right?
1348;AA052BA;Getting used to pulling the trigger?
4359;AZ007Q;Civilian on battlefield in sight. Hey, we'll drop off the vehicle. Get on.
888;AM004DA;I'll back you up!
2915;AZ048G;This is DE202. Did I hit it?
2174;AE131_064;Oh no! We're all gonna die!
876;AM049CA;That's not right!
2541;AEX04_443;Flying types, flying out from the nest!
933;AM186BB;This is for a living.
3998;AE176_041;Infantry unit, wipe out aggressor's species gamma and defend AFV.
2948;AA025AB;Exercise your body, but exercise your mind more.
1364;AC009CB;Plasma Drive, full output.
1349;AT111BC;Destroy the web
1649;AA027DC;Stabilizer, condition one.
1589;AA018CA;Check the surroundings from above.
1456;AF006Y;Perfect chance to strike first!
2506;AE022V;The strategy is simple, kill them all!
1400;AE109_007;MONSTERS!
2787;AE168_008;We'll have to fight in the fog, must stay sharp!
3237;AE142_043;GAAAAAAAAAAAAA
795;AM060BD;IMPOSSIBLE
1317;AA043DC;Didn't you sleep well last night?
1815;AEX04_475;THERE'S A BUNCH OF ALIENS!
1223;AJ007DC;Continue the operation!
3572;AE176_075;I see, but that base is now under enemy's control.
2230;AE145_046;They're actually aliens wearing armor!
1245;AE211_007;Why can't it fly?
3367;AEX04_413;Damn it! It's too small! I can't get a clean hit!
1109;AR006CA;Forget about the dead!
524;AE004CA;FIRE!
1040;AY060BA;I apologize.
1746;AM140BD;It will definitely come true.
1072;AR031BC;Joe got chewed up!
978;AM082Y;I want to make some money.
3959;AE210_075;But... we have to find a way! We have to!
1394;AM186BC;This is for a living.
1176;AT009BB;I can't get away!
1677;AA027BE;I start to feel hungry.
1465;AE202_050;I hope you can make it back safe.
1129;AE003V;SHOOT!
1387;AS005FB;Set me free!
2579;AE198_001;All units, hold position. The Barker team has arrived.
1150;AA032AB;Let's reverse the tide!
915;AC011BE;I will survive.
650;AY067BB;No problem.
887;AM123DD;Thank you!
578;AM070AA;Really?
1931;AE163_055;All members, fire at the enemies!
2547;AA033AC;If this operation succeeds, we can change the result!
1283;AB007BA;Hey, time to move!
2978;AE123_004;AN ALIEN SHIP IS OUTSIDE! PLEASE SAVE US!
2344;AA112BE;Looks like the war situation is in our favor.
2009;AD010AC;They're out of range! Let's get closer!
3811;AE104_039;Help us! Monsters! There are monsters outside my home!
795;AA076BA;Did you hear something?
4474;AE001_013;I heard it was developed for military use, and has the same power output as a tank.
1438;AM026BA;How long have you been practicing?
2018;AE058BB;Ah-
2312;AE164_009;There are aliens inside the shield!
626;AE008Y;Bastard
3896;AR004DC;Oh, no! The captain is... Contact the headquarters!
1524;AC006CA;Maximize sensor output.
504;AM051DC;NO!
439;AM090X;HUH?!
1503;AE176_035;Discover the flying time!
1732;AEX04_598;Rocket Launchers, engage!
1340;AP021BC;Nice, one kill!
1042;AY056DB;I'm outta here.
798;AM004BE;I'll help you!
1381;AE004_015;WHAT ARE THOSE?!
1083;AB011BC;We're running again?
2169;AM178BA;Because I can't let them take over the Earth like that.
6758;AE202_087;I'm just doing my job. After all, I'm a strategic support AI that manages all incoming intelligence.
1997;AE163_048;A large horde of flying objects!
1327;AE190_010;GO! GO!
2380;AE059BC;YAAAAAAAAAA!
1275;AA121BD;I'll kill them all!
2778;AT003BE;IT'S PULLING ME AWAY! IT'S SO STRONG!
1112;AM188BD;This is for love.
7153;AE202_082;Even if we found it, there would be nothing we could do about it. We can't even destroy a mothership, let alone their command ship.
732;AM035X;Forget it.
1036;AM099DA;That's not true!
1778;AM028BC;I'll treat you to a nice meal.
752;AP004ZA;Direct hit!
3242;AA140BB;Because the powered exoskeletons were developed by the military.
1671;AA136BB;Leave it to us, fencers!
1049;AE105_015;GAAAAAAH!
1953;AA045BD;Let's see who kills the most enemies!
726;AY067BC;No problem.
3739;AE002_042;There should be a powered exoskeleton hanger on the floor above!
1439;AE197_023;I've received some intel.
1419;AA027BD;I start to feel hungry.
1210;AE017W;SHOOT AT THE LEFT!
1533;AT001BC;OH! AHHH!!!!
2359;AE153_005;This is Nix1, cover the sides for me!
1690;AA035CB;Fly in the dark like a bat.
2348;AE002_074;Those creatures ate their way through the wall to get in!
670;AM035DC;Yes, sir!
3896;AE186_052;It's over. Retreat. Retreat now!
949;AM134BC;I won't deny you.
2389;AO026BC;Reloading! I don't need backup!
3162;AE002_134;Hold on, Sergeant. I need some mental preparation.
2208;AZ009I;Hey civilian, do you know the enemy's location?
1459;AP015DB;Prey eliminated!
2137;AF007BC;Enemy in sight! Let's attack!
1973;AE186_022;Protect the powered exoskeleton!
1201;AE010BE;I'M AIMING AT YOU!
3016;AE191_026;We found them! There's so many of them!
1449;AF013DB;Hush! They might find us!
1978;AS005DA;LET ME DOWN!
1112;AE176_003;Commence operation!
3727;AE198_075;Noble to Barger B. Detachment procedure in place.
2760;AE205_032;I can't believe they're deploying new forces at this stage!
1657;AO014BA;Crap, I don't have bullets!
844;AM058DC;That makes sense.
940;AM015BD;Nice!
2778;AE196_003;Destroy the web, and rescue the survivors!
2327;AI003Y;Damn it hurts, but I can still fight!
7677;AU131DB;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
5601;AE128_008;Fencers and powered exoskeletons are our shields now. We are in charge of sniping the enemies.
841;AM017X;Affirmative!
3840;AE104_003;People here are all civilians! We can't just let those monsters attack them!
580;AM040BC;Yes!
2611;AE133_032;SHOOT THE EGGS! DESTROY ALL OF THEM!
446;AQ002BB;Whoa!
1297;AE200_012;WE CAN'T ADVANCE!
677;AM096DC;NO!
2685;AS005BD;HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
2807;AE210_098;This is futile! The enemy is too powerful!
2359;AT004DD;The web is... request for backup!
1199;AE167_005;Destroy it at once!
1062;AL010W;Neutralized
1255;AC016DA;Switch to reckless mode!
1594;AA109BC;Being a soldier is my duty.
831;AM171BD;I'm grateful!
935;AM165BE;Let me thank you.
1965;AN008DC;Wingdivers, at your command.
1305;AE110_031;There are too many monsters!
1196;AE191_018;Over here! Hurry up!
842;AM026X;Affirmative!
2133;AE206_010;Find the combat-ready troops and back them up!
1146;AE163_001;Assault!
1347;AEX04_626;Wingdiver, engage!
1420;AE007DC;Let's destroy the target!
847;AF016AA;Don't wake them up.
20074;AE104_028;So far, the identity of the flying objects remains unclear as governments worldwide deny involvement. And it hasn't been confirmed whether other organizations are involved. Although the government promised to clarify the situation, the current state is in chaos for authorities in question, so the situation remains obscure.
3192;AE138_017;We can turn the tide once the railguns arrive. Hold on!
1574;AA002CA;Show them what a diver's got!
1140;AI013BA;The wound is hurting!
6296;AE204_022;We will be running our operation from underground. It is not the time for despair yet. We will keep on the fight!
1676;AI013DB;The wings can't hold any longer!
833;AP019BD;How's that?
1134;AE067BE;Don't get in my way!
1004;AM025CB;I can't approve.
5080;AE137_016;According to the reports from the Air Force, enemies' mobile base seems to be moving towards this area.
2046;AT202AC;Destroy the net! Save our guys!
837;AM118DD;Let's do it!
2583;AE138_058;It penetrated the enemies with a single shot!
913;AA035BD;Get fired up!
2160;AE207_021;Those guys are rootless!
3805;AE130_016;Get in formation! Protect the infantry and start the bombardment!
3203;AE190_050;Air Force still standing by. Please provide air strike coordinates.
1613;AEX04_359;Confirmed! Battle Robot!
1914;AF016BA;Keep quiet or the enemy will hear us!
1386;AEX04_596;Rocket launchers, attack!
2322;AZ029O;A system error has occurred, we'll need to reboot.
1662;AE149_027;Shoot the missiles down!
1277;AE200_020;Diver one, attack!
1900;AE204_007;Run? Where to?
906;AE013BE;WATCH THIS!
1987;AE183_027;We can't hold them off any longer!
2362;AE002_132;There might be monsters! Stay alert!
1404;AE127_007;Don't get close to the enemy!
2027;AE204_016;Offend your comrades in the base!
822;AE025AC;Body shot!
1256;AE035AC;I'll leave the left to you!
526;AM081BA;That's right.
1197;AE200_015;GET TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP!
1819;AJ013BB;We can't fight without a commander!
1348;AH025BB;Are you alright, Captain?
976;AY062BD;I shouldn't have done that.
716;AM105BC;I knew it!
22792;AE112_017;This is a war situation report. In order to stop the enemy from dropping monsters, EDF launched attacks against the large flying saucers and damaged them successfully. The war situation is getting better. In addition, EDF is developing a new type of aircraft, which will be able to destroy the enemy's shield. The development will be completed soon.
818;AM020BC;Good job!
2099;AL024DD;Landing, machine is normal.
5110;AE171_044;We need to wear it down faster than it can regenerate. We're still working on the strategy.
770;AC020AC;Plan X.
1728;AE049BB;NOW! ATTACK THE HEAD!
2089;AEX04_347;CONFIRMED! WINGED FLYING AGGRESSOR!
1890;AE198_062;Attacks coming from both sides!
630;AM007BC;Don't give up.
928;AN015DA;Let me help you.
898;AT102DD;It's a trap!
1358;AE174_015;Those are robots!
847;AB005DD;Keep moving!
5766;AE144_027;The giant flying type will be called Queen from now on. Attack and eliminate the Queen!
7095;AE133_043;Good job! We successfully stopped the monsters from reproducing. Although much sacrifice was made, it was worth it.
1940;AE164_016;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1966;AA112BA;Looks like the war situation is in our favor.
1150;AR042BC;OUR REVENGE!
1080;AP025BB;Took care of one!
792;AM005BC;I'll back you up.
1990;AE002_105;Those things are spitting acid at us!
1274;AE026AA;LET'S TAKE IT DOWN!
842;AE015BD;How's that?
1084;AY060DB;I apologize.
2485;AE170_008;Sargent is alive! We can't leave him here!
629;AE197_024;Go on.
1255;AE162_005;They're already doing that!
784;AM008Z;Yes!
909;AEX04_144;Open fire!
2597;AE210_024;Aim at the mothership's giant cannon. Destroy them!
1206;AR037BE;Ray got chewed up!
2970;AE183_021;It's them or us! Fight for our survival!
1723;AA029DD;Flight system all checked.
1261;AL040BE;We've done our part, right?
1397;AM076DD;That's common sense!
1556;AE198_018;Baga4, attack now!
1553;AE198_054;Infantry unit, cover us!
787;AM063CB;Whoa!
743;AE211_052;What do you mean?
1339;AI005AA;Cover me while I recover!
1115;AY030BC;That was close.
449;AM058BB;No.
2860;AE199_003;It's dead silent. What is going on?
1510;AR017DD;One person is missing!
1062;AE139_012;Ready to attack!
1539;AE161_011;They're rollin' towards us!
1618;AA078DC;I don't hate caves.
1654;AEX04_437;That Aranea is a mutant!
587;AP001BE;We hit it!
2266;AO021BD;The magazine is empty! What should I do?!
1051;AN009AC;I'll leave the team to you.
1115;AM022DB;That's amazing!
1889;AE121_055;What the hell is that?!
1307;AR017DB;One person is missing!
1047;AA039BC;Are you petrified?
2751;AE105_005;Are you suggesting that it was created by aliens?
1349;AEX04_346;Confirmed, cosmonaut!
540;AM051X;NO
3128;AEX02_001;If you don't get here ASAP, we'll all bite the dust!
1473;AH009AC;You make it! Don't worry!
698;AA006AB;His plan.
1553;AE133_030;Look! Here are some eggs!
702;AZ023Q;Disconnected.
2298;AE195_014;Teleportation Anchor has taken damage!
1752;AE150_011;Many different kinds of monsters!
1722;AS003FA;Ah, no!
453;AN010BA;Goodbye.
2300;AC009DD;System normal. Ready to engage.
520;AM161DA;Huh?
775;AP001Y;I got it!
2208;AE104_038;Aim at the upper part of the pylons!
6896;AU142BB;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1889;AY065BB;I will never do that again.
3834;AE127_033;This is nothing like the Battle of Austerlitz! More like Waterloo!
1688;AE141_031;Main force, ready to approach.
1151;AO002BB;Reloading ammo.
1818;AL038DD;Hahahaha!
1243;AM074BE;We can't afford that!
24095;AE115_003;It's dangerous to keep hiding in the same place. The enemy will keep aiming at the same location where the targets vanished, thinking that the targets will show up at that place again. That means the enemy usually pays special attention to the place their targets are last seen. So once you hide yourself, move to different places right away and you will be able to flank the enemy from behind. Get it?
3309;AA016Z;Remember, you are wearing powered exoskeletons.
713;AE002_068;Monsters
1889;AK005W;Something's showing up on our sensors!
1841;AT102BA;I'm tangled in the threads and can't move!
715;AM159BC;Thank you, sir.
1205;AE123_028;How's the negotiations?
2209;AA085DD;I so want to go back outside.
1518;AE106_003;We should go save our men!
847;AM053DC;Impossible!
874;AM007X;DON'T YOU GIVE UP!
3174;AT311DC;It turns out all I heard is true. Thank you.
1146;AR033BC;HAL GOT SHOOT UP!
1065;AM129DB;I have to thank you.
1372;AT107BB;Damn! I can't move!
883;AP008BA;NICE HIT!
1900;AE141_032;Titans, approaching!
2375;AF009AA;Move to a better position before the enemy finds us.
3211;AA091DC;I'm surprised that the military would manufacture aerial units.
1392;AA025ZA;Enjoy the night flying!
1703;AEX04_113;Request artillery support.
513;AQ006AC;DAMN
1854;AD007DB;Asking permission for flight combat!
1403;AA065BB;Why did you join the EDF?
1089;AE020W;MORE TO THE LEFT!
1070;AA041W;Why are you here?
785;AM043DC;No way!
1939;AL033DB;Okay, let's call it a day.
1498;AE117_008;Move in! Let's go!
1331;AM006BE;I'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING!
1679;AE132_004;You're screwed if you fall down.
2478;AE136_001;Infantry unit, accompany the EMC.
4466;AE159_028;This finding is crucial. Approach their nest and collect data.
969;AY042DB;Nice meeting you.
2960;AL007Y;E-D-F! E-D-F!
706;AE180_005;I agree.
1063;AG006CB;The enemy's here!
3231;AE157_025;Shield bearers have caused serious damage to Australia.
999;AA097BC;I wanna go home.
650;AQ013BC;I've been hit!
2002;AE178_019;Teleportation ships approaching. Look out!
1178;AM109DB;Let's do it your way.
2884;AE138_014;It's suicide to fight in such an open space!
1357;AF003BA;I think we can approach them now.
2084;AE141_091;It's time for the showdown with the aliens!
3111;AE102_001;Is this true? What if we're wrong?
1960;AC014DD;Stabilizer, up and running.
1015;AY035DA;So sad.
957;AS004DA;Stop it!
3314;AA092DC;But it seems that aerial units were supposed to be military technology.
1438;AA028ZA;Let's fly in the cave!
1380;AC016BE;It's almost my turn.
1707;AE128_010;Tanks, prepare for battle!
1268;AEX04_370;Confirmed! Mothership!
744;AB004DC;Let's move!
1602;AO006CA;Weapon system, reactivate!
753;AO008ZA;Cool down.
803;AM014CB;Impressive!
942;AP003CA;Confirmed hit!
691;AN002BE;I'll back you up.
730;AE191_010;Destroy it!
2291;AE192_010;The mother monster is calling the monsters!
2485;AE119_030;We're at a disadvantage here! Just enter the shore!
636;AM062BC;I'm sorry.
1345;AE004_081;They're coming from the left!
745;AR015DA;One fell!
1699;AO014BD;Crap! I don't have bullets!
3205;AA065DD;This job is dangerous. What keeps you from leaving?
2778;AT302DA;You're the one destroying the web for me? Thank you.
1923;AE186_043;Keep attacking! Destroy the nest!
2319;AD015DC;I can't wait any longer. Let me shoot.
902;AP008DC;One defeated!
3309;AA055DD;A pilot who is too beautiful to look at. That's me.
2370;AE159_027;A monster's nest? Really?
2429;AE150_022;Teleportation ship is down. Two to go.
929;AM061CB;It happens.
496;AL009AB;Clear!
2070;AEX04_597;Rocket launchers. Charge enemy lines.
3164;AA030ZA;We are the Storm Team! We must not bring shame on our team!
447;AQ002W;Ugh!
1558;AS001EE;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
869;AM108BE;That's not right!
4457;AE211_047;That alien is the incarnation of death! It will kill us all!
1629;AM166BD;Anything you want. My treat.
1376;AC018BD;I'm counting on you, partner.
1539;AE010BD;I'M AIMING AT YOU!
2167;AE143_036;Hey look, that's a huge anchor!
1400;AY032BC;I'm very sad.
2031;AE206_021;Just two! We're ready to engage!
3469;AT102BD;I'm tangled in the threats and can't move!
1041;AY061DC;I'll be more careful.
2311;AE205_028;Storm One, I knew you would come!
867;AD004AC;Ready your weapon!
721;AP006BE;We got one!
1592;AA045BA;Let's see who kills the most enemies!
785;AE001_032;BWAH!
649;AM035DD;Yes, sir!
2766;AE129_023;Teleportation ships sighted in front of the base!
3237;AE134_006;They're trying to suppress this area! Things are gonna get rough!
474;AM064CB;WHAT?!
2114;AW001W;You saved my life. Thank you.
4298;AE105_070;Don't spare any drones, or they will attack civilians! Destroy them all!
2235;AE144_037;We've detected a giant organism among them!
1215;AM103DA;You better keep it to yourself!
1526;AL011X;WE'VE WIPED THEM ALL OUT!
1227;AE003_005;There are still that many?!
3130;AE142_010;Look! The monsters are coming out from the ground!
1570;AM149BE;THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE!
661;AM063CA;Whoa!
4963;AE117_063;Damn, it's too dangerous to move on. I hate to say this, but we should retreat.
799;AM019ZA;I'm against it.
1737;AA101DB;Wingdivers are the best unit.
6893;AU012BB;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
1056;AL007BC;Hooray!
1654;AL004X;Oooooooh!
6227;AE143_012;There's no use hiding in the buildings if the anchors crash down! Estimate the dropping location and dodge the attack!
1568;AE145_021;Search and destroy complete.
2348;AE159_030;Team 1, eliminate the nearby flying type.
1425;AE036AB;I'LL LEAVE THE FRONT TO YOU!
825;AM215BC;What's happening?
2349;AM144DA;Because the sky is so blue and beautiful.
1137;AY007BD;I owe you a big one.
6297;AE104_016;How can anyone create those horrible things? I'll find out who's behind all this horrible stuff and teach the guy a lesson.
766;AM030AB;Let's try it!
740;AM117DA;Shut up!
710;AY070BB;Fine by me.
1026;AE206_009;There are survivors?
2143;AE114_021;What the hell is the mothership trying to do?
471;AE158_027;Copy!
2302;AEX04_661;This is Spriggan Unit, commencing operation.
1656;AA016V;Just focus on your duties!
423;AM046BA;YES!
2343;AA106BC;I was still a security guard until last week.
2014;AN028DB;It's a dream to fight together with a hero.
926;AD004BC;Ready to shoot!
1150;AK017BC;This is hopeless!
1204;AP007DB;Hit confirmed!
1434;AH014BA;I'll check on your wound later!
1275;AM074BD;We can't afford that!
1505;AE161_010;They curled up into a ball!
844;AM003BC;I'm coming to help!
603;AE188_008;FIRE!
1395;AR023BE;Dammit! He died!
1857;AE105_016;Noooooo!
1213;AY077BE;Hey, we're buddies!
2163;AEX04_631;This is Fencer. Hostiles confirmed.
3445;AA144BB;Although I am familiar with the use of private powered exoskeletons.
1064;AI007BC;Where's the medic?
1290;AE113_019;Easy victory!
898;AH009BA;HOLD ON BUDDY
1113;AH021BC;We have an injured here!
2437;AI010DB;Ugh! My wounds!
2505;AA020DC;No one can stand up to an attack from the sky!
2474;AN009CB;Don't get mistaken, I'm only doing my job.
695;AP001CB;IT'S A HIT!
1407;AE004_062;INCOMING ROBOTS!
1337;AEX04_466;The queen is flying in!
933;AY010BC;You're my hero.
1630;AL015DC;We took down the last one!
2082;AV002W;Destroy the web and save our buddies!
3139;AE002_026;Look at the fangs! If you get bitten, you will die!
1825;AM127BB;Look carefully! You're wrong!
1192;AZ014L;Prepare to submerge!
1088;AE178_032;AMAZING!
1762;AE117_040;Are there other teams here besides us?
880;AM005X;You hurt bad?
1593;AJ002BE;This situation is terrible!
1374;AA049BE;I'm a gambling genius.
784;AY014DB;I recovered.
533;AM202BD;AHHH
635;AM023CA;Approved!
643;AM032Y;Impossible.
1611;AA102DA;We should never lose to fencers.
1166;AK003Y;Something is out there!
1719;AO008CA;Transfer power to weapons!
1517;AR017BA;IT LOOKS LIKE ONE MAN DIED!
605;AH003BA;EVADE!
709;AQ008BB;I've been shot!
3258;AE162_004;Yeah, even if they have to force people to join.
1595;AM025BA;This is what the training does!
2468;AD014DA;I'll shoot you dead once you step into range!
1232;AA071BD;What is your purpose?
342;AQ002BA;Ugh!
2508;AE001_001;You must be the newbie. Shall we start?
6613;AE179_044;We need the Large Crane in order to defeat Arcalus. If that's the case, our sacrifices will not be in vain.
1172;AS001ED;AAAAAAAH!
1254;AE176_033;Line in formation!
7649;AU161BA;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
1063;AR013BD;One man died!
1369;AK019BC;There seem to be more enemies!
1035;AB007ZA;Let's fly!
2652;AT103DA;I can't move! Help me!
1236;AZ011PA;Target confirmed.
705;AM006Y;I'll cover you!
1392;AE135_021;Rendezvous with Ranger One.
1299;AF002W;The enemy didn't attack us.
1109;AD021BD;I'll show it to ya!
2804;AE119_021;THEY'RE TOO FAST! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO RUN AWAY!
1658;AEX04_322;Species Alpha incoming!
756;AE002_091;AHHH!
1483;AT002DC;Wings are unable to stretch!
1309;AR006DC;REVENGE FOR THE CAPTAIN!
804;AZ010I;I see smoke.
926;AG008Z;Let's start!
1032;AE100_031;Impressive!
3380;AA023AA;Leave tomorrow for tomorrow. Let's focus on how to win today first.
2097;AM028BA;I'll treat you to a nice meal!
1619;AM041W;It's rare that I agree with you.
824;AM006DA;Stay strong!
7631;AE146_001;This city is occupied by the aliens. We're all hiding in a building. We've escaped the worst. But God knows for how long.
831;AM030CA;I can't approve!
2236;AE057BA;Spend your time on something more meaningful!
1060;AY040DC;At your service.
2280;AD007Y;Stay calm. Estimate the distance.
939;AO003BA;RELOAD!
758;AM045AA;Sounds fair.
2784;AE111_006;THE LORD'S FLYING SAUCERS ARE DROPPING MONSTERS!
2664;AEX04_218;Don't expect those things to be slowed down by the cold.
2286;AA015CB;Don't depend too much on stabilizers.
1422;AI009DC;An error in the flight system?
834;AM208BD;WOAH!
2057;AA020DB;No one can stand up to an attack from the sky.
1839;AEX04_197;Defend the powered exoskeleton!
4233;AE190_038;Ranger 1-5 has been wiped out! We can't hold any longer!
6148;AE143_066;So the creators of the civilization made the aliens into cyborgs and control them, similar to the monsters?
565;AL012CB;CLEAR!
1251;AP003X;I TOOK IT DOWN!
988;AP016BE;Took one down!
4412;AE202_081;Can't find the egg-shaped ship. Can't find it.
765;AM027DD;Yes, sir.
2019;AE108_017;I can't believe we are fighting aliens!
3430;AE195_024;Am I dreaming? We're saved!
1764;AE205_010;It's flying type monsters!
941;AM173BC;You saved my life!
5047;AE124_017;You just witnessed and survived from hell, newbie. Come back for some rest.
1509;AC007BC;Let's start the fight soon!
2397;AE155_018;WE'RE INVINCIBLE! BELIEVE IN THAT!
1207;AE158_008;Go, go, go!
2756;AE198_033;Bargain 2 here! I've taken multiple hits!
800;AB006AB;Go, go!
937;AM024BD;Respect!
2162;AF016BC;Keep quiet, or the enemy will hear us!
1576;AT003AB;You wanna pull me over?
1760;AE129_050;This is Titan. We are in position.
963;AEX04_128;Hit confirmed!
777;AR015DC;One fell!
2011;AA086DC;I really can't take this!
1126;AB006DB;Prepare to fly!
1018;AP015BA;We got one!
903;AR033BA;HAL got chewed up!
1386;AO005BA;Reloading ammo
866;AS003AC;Let me down!
834;AE150_001;Lights on!
822;AP006Y;It's finished!
1218;AR033BE;HAL GOT CHEWED UP!
2170;AEX04_343;CONFIRMED! ALIEN IN SPACE SUIT!
875;AE040BA;HAVING FUN?
4758;AE211_115;Yet still, we will fight for our survival and win!
1834;AE006_005;Flying saucers are coming!
2446;AT304BB;Who destroyed the net? I must thank him!
4058;AE188_004;I was selected for my talent as a sniper. I'm destined for this duty.
2389;AA036CB;Become a Nighthawk, hovering in dark nights.
1365;AE020BE;FIRE YOUR WEAPON!
1273;AM122DA;Stop daydreaming!
1564;AD018BE;Take them down when they get closer.
1053;AC027DC;Party time.
951;AE161_024;What's that sound?
2554;AE131_061;I can't believe there's an army underground!
1897;AZ020I;A civilian request for bombing!
472;AM041DD;No.
702;AM038DC;Understood.
1692;AE133_013;Hey look! What's that?
3734;AE108_013;If we don't destroy the pylons, the monsters will take over the city!
1367;AI003DB;I failed to increase output!
1043;AM102BA;That's what we were taught!
2104;AA096BC;I want to breathe the air outside.
1501;AK019BD;There seem to be more enemies!
1158;AE132_029;You're extraordinary!
1275;AR023BD;Damn it! He died!
2153;AEX04_232;Oh no! The fog is getting thicker!
1562;AJ008Y;Sergeant, please reply!
2551;AE174_033;Long Type DeRoy successfully destroyed!
1515;AF005DA;Asking for permission to attack.
1893;AT106AC;Over here! Save me!
397;AM037BE;Sure!
764;AM012AC;That's great!
1725;AM118BE;It's only your fantasy.
1772;AE174_019;Shoot the missiles down!
1052;AY003DB;I want to thank you.
723;AM047AB;Let's go with it.
1502;AE199_002;I don't see any civilians either.
2108;AH008AC;Don't die! I'll get you home alive!
2423;AT305AB;I'm still alive. It's all thanks to you.
3004;AE210_047;This is ground unit! We're under heavy artillery fire!
4073;AE128_025;This is Scout, enemy landing ships confirmed. There are a lot of them.
1294;AE210_002;Approach the mothership!
800;AP020BA;YOU DESERVE IT!
691;AM012ZA;Approved.
420;AB006BC;GO!
762;AY071DC;It happens.
516;AM088Y;Gah!
1992;AE138_007;SHIELDS, DEPLOY!
952;AEX04_640;Spencer moving in.
3709;AEX04_573;This is Ranger 23. We're in position. Commencing operation.
1962;AA029AA;This is a battle we cannot lose.
1049;AE159_066;Retreat now!
4061;AE199_017;Monsters! They are eating the buildings!
2618;AT305DB;You saved me, right? How should I thank you?
1687;AE200_023;Wingdivers, scatter the enemy!
1151;AR007AC;Hey, you dead?
1795;AH026BA;Captain, I won't let you die!
1290;AM197BC;It just somehow happened.
927;AR014BA;One man down!
640;AM035DA;Yes, sir.
800;AE004CB;FIRE!
1024;AE005BA;Go to hell!
448;AY052BC;Buh-bye!
644;AM126DC;Thanks!
996;AN027DD;My pleasure!
663;AM126DD;Thanks!
2383;AT106BA;I can't get out! I can't!
1076;AM107DB;That would be nice.
1106;AT104AC;I CAN'T MOVE AT ALL!
2911;AN009DA;Because there's no commander here, we'll join forces with your team.
2100;AA005BD;It's gonna be another real battle today.
2502;AA088DC;I feel like I'm assimilated with those bats.
1838;AE136_007;We're about to relaunch Airstrike.
5370;AE159_072;We don't have the necessary equipment to destroy that nest. We'll retreat for now and think of a better plan.
7484;AU031BC;High up in the air our comrades fight, Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light.
1313;AE153_036;Enemies in large number!
1655;AE029BA;DON'T PLAY DUMB, SHOOT!
1685;AE044AA;Humankind will fight to the end!
935;AM044DC;Impossible!
1289;AE207_007;This is our last run!
3343;AE143_003;They're right ahead! We have no choice but to deal with them!
5499;AE202_057;Mothership number two has attacked the EDF headquarters. The HQ is destroyed.
2281;AE161_027;Confirmed to be monsters! Be careful!
2076;AI019BD;Damn! It's painful!
1405;AE145_047;There are aliens inside!
1275;AP002BA;We took out the enemy!
583;AM035AC;Next time.
948;AD002V;Prepare to shoot!
1078;AE197_001;THEY'RE COMING!
1675;AQ009AC;AAAAAGHHHH!!!
1345;AL049BA;Time to find the next enemy.
1716;AE114_037;THEY'RE HOVERING IN THE SKY!
2023;AE121_009;Drones are defending the base!
868;AE153_002;ADVANCE!
2719;AA046V;I will bring you back to the ground, no worries!
433;AQ004AB;AHHH
1217;AK007DD;There's something coming!
520;AM160DD;What?!
801;AN011BA;I'll defend you.
1261;AO022BB;Is the gun jammed?
941;AB005DA;Get moving!
2047;AE004_020;I can't believe it, they're aliens!
1266;AT201DD;The Allies got stuck!
1828;AZ027H;Cannon! Fire!
592;AM062DC;Think so.
972;AN017DB;Nice meeting you.
6846;AE210_034;North America hasn't reported anything like this. This is the first time all mother ships are heading to the same location.
2268;AL015AA;We did it! Let's go for the next enemy!
1914;AE191_008;IT'S A TELEPORTATION DEVICE!
1301;AS001BE;AHHHHH!
628;AM021AA;You're good!
1690;AH024BD;Captain, please, hold on!
1883;AT310DC;It's my privilege to be saved by you.
880;AY040DA;At your service.
1025;AY030BE;That was close!
899;AE005V;SHOOT!
1010;AE008BB;Go to hell!
817;AE211_107;NO!
1379;AM129BD;Confirm once again!
644;AE009DA;This way!
1527;AN003BD;What are you doing, civilian?
1363;AL027BC;I took down the enemy!
1237;AP002CB;Hit! Defeated it!
1466;AN010DB;I'll be in charge of protecting you.
1604;AN028BE;You? To be our captain?
2543;AD004DD;We'll launch the attack once they get into range!
405;AQ001BD;AH!
1937;AE159_039;Are we really gonna climb this mountain?
6151;AE162_013;The hooligan cannons are still in experimental stage and can't fire consecutively. We have to shut them down for now.
1425;AE100_021;Not even close!
1337;AE176_016;The shotgun came in handy!
1142;AB015BA;MOVE! MOVE!
2120;AA060DD;What is the reason you joined the EDF?
1397;AG004BA;The enemy's closing in!
2551;AI016BB;Oh no, my eyes are blurry!
2037;AEX04_417;Dangerous monsters incoming!
995;AG001AC;NOW! SHOOT!
2003;AA027AC;Trust yourselves, and trust your superiors.
2107;AT310DD;It's my privilege to be saved by you!
1461;AE131_066;I DON'T WANT TO DIE HERE!
1841;AT203BD;Go save the ones caught on the web!
2270;AE171_021;Confirmed to be large teleportation anchors!
1489;AO006Y;I'm reloading! Back me up!
3276;AE146_039;You're not part of the rescue teams. That's really something.
545;AE004BB;FIRE!
1703;AE109_021;INCOMING MONSTERS!
724;AM069BA;Impossible!
2727;AEX04_553;We've reached destination! Commencing operation!
1490;AM143DC;Because I love the sky.
2682;AE198_009;Barga7's foot has taken some minor damage!
495;AM026DC;Got it!
2262;AE130_019;Requiem cannon! Fire!
2770;AE131_029;I heard something! There seems to be something up ahead!
2709;AE179_017;The other side must be crawling with monsters!
756;AM054AA;No way.
1063;AA076BD;Did you hear something?
1502;AE166_024;Don't they have weak points?
2781;AA065DB;This job is dangerous. What keeps you from leaving?
1303;AE121_059;All units, retreat!
6640;AU112W;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong.
1603;AM026BE;How long have you been practicing?
1097;AE003Y;YEAH!
8752;AE166_023;But days ago, the same enemies landed in North America. Our men were completely annihilated, and they took control of many of our strongholds.
7545;AU031Y;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
7587;AU171AB;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1359;AD014AB;Confirm the target enemy!
2672;AE191_007;Monsters are coming out from the machinery!
1201;AA044DA;Are you mentally prepared?
2210;AO011BA;I'm not good! I'm out of ammo!
1047;AI007BA;WHERE'S THE MEDIC?!
1518;AM089DD;Do you have a screw loose?
1223;AK004AB;WE HAVE COMPANY!
1386;AA007BC;I never lose.
609;AA002AB;Stay alert!
879;AK003CA;Something's there!
1549;AO008DB;Transfer power to weapons!
2278;AT007BD;It's pulling me away! Somebody help!
392;AB008CB;Yeah!
325;AY025DB;Huh!
936;AP013DA;That one is killed!
1984;AE003_011;Hey! Look at the sky!
4043;AA010X;Nothing good about getting promoted. Being on the battlefield is the best.
1840;AE133_021;The cave seems to be going deeper.
1551;AN018BC;Please let me join your team.
685;AM134DD;Thanks!
456;AQ005BD;Argh!
803;AJ003BA;CRAP!
1402;AE178_021;They wanna keep this base!
2271;AA010W;Soldiers are respected in my hometown.
7620;AU111X;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
1997;AE120_007;Commence night flight. Let's go!
2814;AE136_005;The previous airstrikes already immobilized Erginus.
847;AM063DA;Let's do this.
1404;AZ034G;Minigun, fire!
2320;AC025BB;I'll be the one who kills the most enemies!
1345;AQ014BE;AHHH!
2419;AI020BD;I've seen worse. This is nothing.
1556;AO010DA;Weapon system, cool down!
670;AM047DC;I refuse.
1764;AY009BD;Next time, I'll save you.
594;AY068DB;It's all right.
3405;AE141_077;An alien rights problem? I didn't see that coming.
1365;AD013BC;It's too far to shoot!
654;AM070AB;Really?
1889;AM140BB;It will definitely come true.
1029;AM010BA;DON'T BE DISCOURAGED!
1191;AH003AC;Defend the patients!
2241;AEX04_566;This is Ranger, we've located the target.
7650;AU021V;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1734;AE198_024;Parker1 here! I'm damaged!
1323;AD019DB;Switch to attack mode!
4427;AEX04_520;The monsters will keep coming if we don't destroy the teleportation anchors!
1184;AA004DC;I'll fly faster next time!
1526;AM187BD;This is freedom.
696;AO001Z;Reloading
490;AZ009K;Go!
1070;AE008V;KEEP GOING!
1969;AE141_059;That golden armour is unbreakable!
2169;AF006ZA;Don't shoot! On my command.
2104;AA047DD;There is someone I'm interested in.
2305;AE157_034;Isn't there any better option?
1300;AJ004BD;What should we do now?
4961;AEX04_083;Aerate in three, two, one, zero.
785;AK014BC;NEW ENEMY!
4374;AE210_093;This is useless! Get cover!
1769;AG004W;The enemy is coming this way!
1348;AM100BE;That goes without saying!
507;AM029Y;All right!
754;AM080DC;No!
1032;AG005DC;The enemy saw us!
901;AM189BA;This is for money.
1558;AE123_013;Alien landing ships confirmed!
1115;AE138_046;We'll protect you, kiddo!
1050;AM088BC;That's the truth.
1373;AA123BA;Let's scare the enemy to death!
786;AP005BD;Bullseye!
1241;AM068BC;Let's talk about it later.
3361;AL010BB;E-D-F! E-D-F!
3841;AE003_002;Those idiots on the ground! We took out all the monsters by ourselves!
2188;AEX04_672;This is Alpha, commencing operation.
1676;AA073DB;So here we are underground.
1070;AN007CB;We will move with you!
1270;AO015BA;WHERE'S MY MAGAZINE?!
1025;AN009BC;Let's fight together.
3467;AA007X;Quite a bargain to join the military. You can get paid if you die.
1779;AE117_035;I'm not scared, that's for sure.
2423;AE179_060;We're all set. Open it.
2543;AT010BA;Do something to take down the thread spitting thing!
1960;AE163_031;Permission granted to attack! Fire!
646;AH004V;You alright?
7639;AU171BA;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
925;AM001AA;Keep it together!
1167;AG003V;FIRE!
868;AQ008BE;I've been shot!
1188;AM100BC;That goes without saying!
1317;AR018BE;And now I got chewed up!
3315;AE103_014;There are so many! Will they bring in more monsters?
411;AM202BC;Huh?
1058;AE119_025;FAIR MORE?!
7680;AU111BB;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
1148;AH004AA;Protect the injured!
2402;AA017ZA;If you keep moving, you won't get hit easily.
1031;AY061BD;I'll be more careful.
1011;AH005DC;I'll cover the wounded!
2135;AE146_006;Look! There are fewer aliens now!
933;AM057Y;You've got it wrong!
1118;AH023BC;The captain is injured!
3065;AE115_020;There's no other way than getting rid of those aliens. Let's go!
2531;AE120_015;Oh no! They're calling monsters!
1114;AM019BC;That's amazing!
1354;AO016BB;Where are my bullets?!
3323;AE130_009;It's a giant tank extending over hundreds of meters!
1382;AN004W;Don't worry, it's all right.
1762;AL012AC;Confirm if we've exterminated them all.
355;AQ001ZA;AH!
1576;AE103_008;They look mechanical!
1343;AE019BA;HEY! NO!
2625;AQ008DB;Whoa!
2791;AA124BE;They shouldn't have run into us. Tough luck for them.
2085;AI006BC;Oh no, we need healing!
1147;AA010CA;Stay on cruise mode!
940;AH018BA;ARE YOU ATTACKED?!
854;AA073BA;It's so dark.
2204;AEX04_100;GARINADE CANNON, OPEN FIRE!
1181;AE045BE;Attack, you're right!
1907;AA006Z;Kill the enemies! Send them to hell!
1741;AE159_015;Flying-type monsters confirmed!
1256;AN008AA;This team will protect you.
3506;AE119_042;Don't freak out! We can bring it down if we keep on shooting!
1692;AR017BD;It looks like one man died!
1182;AE005_052;An explosion!
775;AM142DC;That's fate.
2810;AE125_002;Teams that have closed in on the artillery, attack now!
3856;AE161_008;We still don't know what these monsters are capable of. Be cautious.
3686;AE167_015;The Big Anchor will transfer lots of different monsters! Stay alert!
3342;AA126BE;We have weapons as good as tanks, show them what we have!
1614;AEX04_114;Open fire right away!
5397;AE141_037;This is Swallow 1. Ground forces are in danger! We'll launch an air strike toward the base!
3101;AE110_020;A large troop of flying saucers is coming from above. Beware!
1798;AS001DB;AHHHHH!
1188;AO031BA;SWAP THE CARDRAGE!
916;AE011X;Take this!
511;AY043BE;Good morning.
2849;AE118_009;Urgentness will indeed pass through this area.
1365;AM103DB;Better keep it to yourself!
1158;AE143_004;DESTROY THEM!
1987;AE163_037;These things eat people!
1560;AM193BC;I've always wanted to do so.
2844;AA105BE;I had done the training for a guard, but not for a soldier.
1051;AM206BB;Is that how it is?
1176;AM102BE;That's what we were taught!
907;AE166_006;Enemies to the right!
14816;AE143_065;We already know the devices on the aliens are communicators, which are also their life-supporting equipment on Earth. But after some further investigation, we found out another essential function. Those machines will affect their brains and body tissues.
665;AE177_010;ENEMIES!
3080;AA097DA;I think I'll stick with flying after leaving the military services.
832;AY072BE;We'll figure it out.
1869;AG005BC;The enemy is coming this way!
1223;AE108_010;Pylon's coming down!
2067;AEX04_546;The body fluid is made of acid!
1662;AA040W;Do you have any reasons to fight?
1780;AF026BB;How long before we can engage?
1831;AA122BA;I can't wait to start the fight!
1163;AP011BE;I took one down!
1436;AL038BC;I'd like to take a rest.
1022;AY073BE;Not a big deal.
1440;AN014BD;I'm counting on you, Captain!
879;AY073DC;It's nothing.
3052;AE121_023;Don't worry about the base! Take out the drones first!
6883;AU122BD;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
9985;AE104_041;Hello? My brother said he saw a monster. It's the size of an elephant. Huh? No? Why? Why don't you believe me?
1956;AE121_013;There are batteries around the base!
1119;AM050DC;That's way too hard!
3372;AE144_020;We're dead! The red ones must be stronger!
1696;AE145_003;So we're still gonna fight!
1549;AEX04_389;An army of monsters!
2910;AY012DC;Nothing to thank you for, I was fine by myself.
1401;AL035BE;It's harder than imagined!
829;AN024BC;Let's go together.
2386;AE211_127;Storm One, we're counting on you.
4432;AE138_040;Elite Fencer Unit has arrived. Infantry Unit, join forces with them at once.
1380;AE029BB;DON'T PLAY DUMB, SHOOT!
3868;AA026ZA;I know you can move swiftly, even though it's narrow here. Now show me!
7686;AU131BA;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
376;AM036DA;Yeah!
2418;AT007BB;It's pulling me away! Somebody help!
987;AE019BB;Hey, now!
4584;AE106_028;Thank God! It's a reinforcement! But what is a civilian doing here?
1019;AM033CB;I won't grant it!
2207;AEX04_327;CONFIRMED MUTATED SPECIES GAMMA
1011;AM095DA;That's not true!
470;AM031W;NO
1400;AA063BD;How about singing a song?
3515;AE173_018;I thought that was the queen, but it doesn't match our data!
2783;AF017BC;Lower your voice or they will find us.
1394;AJ008BB;Somebody help us!
2699;AE192_007;Nearby monsters are all heading this way!
1513;AE130_017;Heavy tanks, attack!
1325;AE111_010;What exactly do they want?
3656;AA012DD;Although combat is tough, I really enjoy flying in the sky!
412;AM032BE;YES
2176;AE127_034;I'm out of ammo. I'm doomed!
3238;AE198_011;All units, approach the enemy! Prepare for close quarter combat!
2575;AE042BA;DID YOU SEE THAT?! I'M UNMATCHED!
1408;AE189_003;That's a huge web!
1130;AM064DA;Ah, that's right!
1779;AI004BB;I can still fight! Ugh!
1185;AR003AB;Damn! Man down!
1498;AM152BE;Okay, okay!
1189;AH025BE;Are you alright, Captain?
3146;AA116BC;I finally understand. It's no use to run away.
1602;AA102BA;Tell my family I fought bravely.
1316;AC018DA;Switch to active mode!
822;AM053DA;Impossible!
1596;AE154_013;Destroy the mother monsters.
2020;AT006BD;I'M STUCK IN THE WEB! HELP ME!
1531;AE142_033;Monsters are coming out!
1344;AA093DA;I was an airshow performer.
1429;AO003DC;Plasma power charge!
765;AL014ZA;It's over.
1055;AY076BB;We're partners, right?
561;AM038ZA;Thank you.
2440;AA015DA;With this aerial unit, monsters are nothing!
2989;AA028V;We've been calling the battlefield home ever since that day!
1266;AH022BD;Our man is injured!
1256;AE162_019;Enemy ship destroyed!
2492;AEX04_565;The reinforcement has arrived. Rendezvous with them.
1761;AE025X;I'LL MAKE YOU A SIDE DISH!
4896;AEX04_729;Thank god you came! I hope you don't mind me saying this, but shouldn't they have said more?
644;AM115BA;You're wrong.
4034;AE123_031;They seem to see us as pests. Still, we have to keep trying to negotiate.
680;AE143_002;TOLD YOU!
1684;AF030BC;Not yet, not yet, not yet!
1664;AA006BA;We must take them down!
4521;AE204_008;The base has been destroyed, there are monsters in the city, and there's nowhere to run to.
2589;AEX04_659;Spriggan unit! Target confirmed! Attacking!
1004;AE124_002;Drones too!
1961;AEX04_548;Take them out before they spit acid!
1783;AA069DB;We can barely fly underground.
3283;AE117_037;Wanna move on? I don't really want to.
1717;AN006ZA;Win this battle, Storm One!
983;AM061DC;Yeah, probably.
2138;AT104BA;Bastard! I can't get out!
1992;AA100BE;I'm unlucky. I'll certainly...
2148;AE141_010;Powered exoskeletons, get in position!
722;AA050AC;Go carefully.
701;AM065CA;What the?!
1469;AI003X;What a shitty day.
437;AB001DA;Go!
1571;AE172_011;Destroyed Shield Bearers!
554;AG003DC;Attack!
924;AK008AB;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
712;AM075DA;You bet!
7593;AU161CA;This city has nothing but despair. All we hear is silence now, cause not us all were spared.
1335;AEX04_488;Heavy Armoured Grays!
2525;AT303BA;Destroy the web? I'm impressed!
2363;AL002DC;Nooooooo!
678;AM105BD;I knew it!
693;AM159BE;Thank you, sir.
1008;AZ002O;Ready for next launch!
3110;AA054BA;You didn't expect to do such a cool thing as protecting the Earth, did you?
2168;AE136_010;What? Give me details.
2734;AE115_029;Attack their feet! That can slow them down!
510;AM014ZA;Noted!
2477;AE200_028;Good job! The shield bearers have been taken down.
1470;AE165_012;Enemy ships, two left!
2119;AE147_020;Damn it! Get your ass down!
2358;AEX04_693;This is Tiger III, Beginning Attack.
1228;AM105DA;Yeah, you're right.
2187;AF015AC;Don't jump the gun. Wait for my order.
1298;AM182BE;This is for my family!
665;AP019BE;How's that?
1383;AA034CA;Don't fool around when flying!
2327;AJ015BD;Someone give us instructions!
4810;AE111_019;There's no end to this. If we don't come up with something fast, it'll become a monster carnival!
2283;AA089BD;It's my first time in a cave like this.
1294;AE176_071;The equivalent weight?
2531;AEX04_650;This is Grim Reaper. We're on the move.
665;AB005DC;Get moving!
785;AY018BB;Should be clear!
1469;AE128_027;Landing ships are descending!
1379;AT301DA;Thank you for coming to help!
798;AM074DC;So I see!
2796;AE132_008;One slip and you're done for. So watch out!
3091;AE135_020;Flying-type monsters confirmed. Commence extermination.
1671;AO003DD;Plasma power, charge!
2249;AS015BC;Somebody kill this guy!
1971;AB001Y;YEAH!
782;AM117BA;You mistook it.
2547;AE004_040;Hold your ground! No way we're handing over the city!
1827;AS005FC;Set me free!
2092;AF016BB;Keep quiet or the enemy will hear us.
1350;AM128BB;You've gotta be kidding me!
1609;AO007W;I'LL SWAP MY MAGAZINES!
760;AM013V;You did it!
1286;AE052BE;ATTACK THE BODY!
1839;AO026BD;Reloading! I don't need backup!
848;AM015DD;Well done!
27223;AE106_031;This is the chief commander of the EDF. We are currently at war with the hostile force. Unfortunately, we suffered a preemptive strike and lost many bases. In addition, our enemy has been launching indiscriminate attacks on our cities by dropping monsters. As I am speaking, the casualties are increasing. Everyone, we have no choice but to fight.
1613;AE110_012;Too late, too late!
2118;AL038DB;Eheheh... Eheheheh... Eheheheh...
807;AE137_002;Well done!
1788;AA030W;I'll show those guys some manners.
858;AL011ZA;We did it!
851;AM018Y;Sir, yes sir!
414;AM058BC;NO
532;AM126DB;Thanks.
1257;AB007BD;Hey, time to move!
1766;AE178_035;I've heard a rumor about a hero.
1686;AE148_014;It's got cannons on the legs!
2288;AA008X;It's my dream to live an easy life with my annuity.
1386;AH021BA;We haven't injured here!
3617;AE157_026;Humans are no match for aliens being protected by the light barrier.
1913;AEX04_141;Uploading coordinates to the satellite.
2546;AA058AA;Stick together, you're screwed if you get separated.
1072;AE002_092;That was close!
1060;AE171_030;THAT'S ARCULUS!
6257;AA098DC;I plan to go back to being an airshow performer after my honorary discharge. I'm confident in doing an amazing show now.
2531;AI004V;I won't die. I've always survived.
2560;AE175_001;It's the queens! They start moving!
593;AM035AA;Next time.
1778;AM006AC;It's no big deal, keep fighting!
596;AM035DB;Yes sir!
1636;AE024BD;Take my bullet!
680;AM060BA;Impossible.
1870;AE159_046;Team 2, heading to the hilltop!
3354;AZ057G;This is DE-202. Good job, civilian!
846;AM064BC;Not possible.
1606;AF003DD;The enemy hasn't found us!
741;AM002AC;Stay calm.
2149;AE114_077;Their self-healing ability is abnormal!
2070;AH008AA;Don't die! I'll get you home alive!
7283;AEX04_378;Looks like an advanced teleportation ship. Its weak spots have been reinforced, but it can be taken down with sustained fire. Keep attacking.
1527;AK002BD;The enemy has been confirmed.
5505;AE211_072;It can transform mind into physical energy. In theory, it has unlimited power.
1870;AE190_003;Next, Master Armor on!
2572;AE141_041;Ground Force, an airstrike will commence momentarily.
4641;AE198_055;Colossal monsters approaching combat areas? It's a horde of urchinists!
3823;AE002_156;Maybe the monsters are biological weapons created by another nation.
2656;AE002_041;We still have one more trick up our sleeve.
1033;AR005DA;The Captain is gone!
1215;AH017BE;KEEP YOUR COOL!
1735;AN005BE;I have no choice. I'll go with you.
2113;AN005DB;I'll protect you until we leave the battlefield.
959;AY040BC;At your service.
1855;AZ006PB;You can launch again if you'd like to.
1161;AM071BB;That's impossible!
1193;AM024DA;You want me to praise you?
2647;AE202_024;The aliens want to build a new Earth.
1313;AJ005X;Anyone call for backup?
768;AP013BE;Defeated it!
1953;AE011BD;Die, you monster!
881;AN018DA;Let's go together!
1680;AE161_013;Eliminate all monsters!
5471;AE179_056;Nothing we can do. Let's just head back. Hey!
775;AM098DB;It's not!
1167;AO007BE;CHANGE THE MAGAZINE!
410;AM041DC;No.
1682;AM127BA;Look carefully! You're wrong!
1307;AS002FD;AHHHHH!
1501;AEX04_366;CONFIRMED! DEATH QUEEN!
5891;AE105_024;Flying saucers are attacking humans. Civilians are in danger, so shoot down as many of them as possible.
5095;AE103_023;The pylons seem to be a device for teleporting monsters! They keep coming! One after another!
1910;AE062BB;I don't wanna die! Not now!
1067;AT301AB;I'm grateful for your help.
1245;AE009AA;SHOOT DOWN THE ENEMY!
2332;AL050BE;It feels great to come back triumphantly.
706;AM024AA;Approved.
1215;AD012DD;That's not good enough!
1359;AK009AA;We still have work to do!
4170;AA055DC;A pilot who was too beautiful to look at? That's me.
1572;AA014DB;Watch me dance like a bird!
1165;AH003AA;Defend the patients!
1818;AA003BD;My shooting skills are good.
1504;AM158BB;You had a dream like that?
1432;AO003DB;Plasma power, charge!
4532;AE106_018;This is Dolphin. We have no way to run. We'll go out of the buildings and strike back!
693;AO003X;Reload!
1483;AL035BC;It's harder than I imagined.
3128;AA033X;Let's teach them a lesson. Don't mess with us humans.
3433;AE131_036;Then if we destroy this place, we can remove the current threat.
3798;AE176_045;Powered exoskeletons will take care of the flying types. You must hang in there.
371;AM033AC;NO
1174;AL024CA;Return to cruise mode!
1226;AE001_051;Good, come with me!
2734;AEX04_574;This is Ranger 31, going in to rescue!
1826;AEX04_514;Spotted shortleg deroys!
1143;AG001BB;Looks like we're found!
1527;AC011DD;Weapon system, unlock!
1146;AE104_005;Tanks! Move out!
1285;AK002BA;The enemy has been confirmed!
1326;AM008BC;Rescue is on the way!
958;AN002Y;Hey, rookie!
1357;AE194_019;STAY CLOSE TO BARGA!
1915;AE119_044;This is Scout. Monsters confirmed.
1170;AD014BE;Still out of range!
1201;AL010AB;Exterminate it!
1562;AA006BB;We must take them down!
1317;AK005X;SOMETHING'S COMING!
1118;AE039AC;Be careful on the left!
1565;AE193_001;WHAT IS THAT?!
1592;AO008CB;Transfer power to weapons!
991;AL008Z;Subdued.
1541;AE130_026;ENEMIES BOMBARDING US!
1040;AN006X;I'm counting on you, dude.
957;AI002BA;A BITCH SHOT!
2836;AE177_048;Well done! Head for base 228 ASAP!
2192;AE057BD;Spend your time on something more meaningful!
1139;AE166_037;THEY'RE TOO STRONG!
1208;AE019Z;GET CLOSE TO THE ENEMY!
3168;AEX04_649;This is Grim Reaper. We're eliminating enemies.
624;AG005AB;COMING!
1934;AS005EE;SAVE ME!
1302;AS003FD;AHHH! NO!
1932;AA024DC;Plasma Drive, Condition 1.
1343;AM061X;Yeah, maybe.
685;AE210_037;We did it!
1197;AM011BE;Don't let it get to you!
1026;AM042DB;That's not gonna work.
1776;AA039AB;We have good chances, so we'll win!
2585;AN001DC;A civilian. I must protect him.
2089;AZ021PB;The circuit burned out! Repair it now!
1259;AR021DD;WE MUST REVENGE!
1602;AQ006V;GAAAAAAHHH!
2088;AA025BD;I will barbecue with my kids on the weekend.
833;AN011BB;I'll defend you.
8798;AE203_012;This area is already lost, but enemy attack shows no sign of slowing down. When we are killed, they will go after the remaining humans. We can't let that happen!
1428;AE128_030;That's a lot of aliens!
2236;AK013DA;I've detected a reaction. What's this?
1228;AA034DB;I'll cover you from the sky.
2111;AY048BD;From now on, we are part of your unit.
785;AY071BA;Nothing happens.
1661;AF005AC;Now! The enemy didn't notice!
1211;AM068BD;Let's talk about it later.
619;AR016BC;One dead!
1156;AP008DB;One defeated.
2656;AE140_022;Keep it together and remember you're trading no matter what!
4152;AE143_068;Disposable assets. No one cares if they'll die from air pollution.
7481;AU011W;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
3291;AE202_043;Number 15 here. Do you have confirmation?
1116;AM069DB;You don't have to tell me.
1018;AE009Z;BE SMASHED!
6800;AE141_092;Operation name, Crossroad. This will be the battle to determine the fate of humanity.
1593;AM151BD;Agreed! Agreed!
2178;AM112DD;Can't we talk about things more interesting?
2524;AE112_050;The red light might be the teleportation device.
1843;AC006BA;I can fight! You can trust me!
948;AM187BA;This is freedom.
1232;AE007BD;DROP DEAD!
1185;AE211_131;Start the attack!
1955;AE177_015;You won't get away with it if you break it!
722;AM045BD;Yes, sir!
2195;AA013AB;EDF is human's hope. Remember that.
806;AM009Y;AMAZING!
3134;AA141BD;Powered exoskeletons were originally a military technology.
493;AM161DD;Huh?
1091;AL025DB;Landed safely.
1277;AF029BB;They didn't see us.
1205;AC024BA;It's party time!
1343;AR029BC;The boss got chewed up!
1560;AM145DD;It's surely out of love.
1378;AI005BD;The injury is nothing!
1781;AN025DA;Wing divers will secure your safety.
1004;AU001X;Help me!
9743;AE107_018;This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. The black monsters we encountered before will be called alpha from now on. The ones that shoot threads will be called beta.
3131;AM011DB;We must continue to fly until all enemies are knocked down!
3157;AY012BC;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
2042;AF031BD;The tension gives me the thrills.
961;AQ005CA;I GOT SHOT!
2626;AT002CB;I can't fly! Support me!
1722;AA076DC;I can't believe we have to fly in the dark.
1695;AE142_022;MONSTERS!
5294;AA133BE;With a powered exoskeleton, even weak men can be strong, but you must train yourself.
869;AM186BD;This is for a living.
1062;AE008DC;Leave this one to me!
3044;AE114_028;Extraterrestrial beings similar to humans.
1257;AM114DB;You love daydreaming.
1427;AK013BE;Did you hear something strange?
853;AL007BD;Hooray!
1846;AE139_013;Aim at the teleportation ships!
1836;AE103_022;This is the world at war!
6417;AE149_026;We'll try that if there is a next time. The city will be in serious trouble if we don't eliminate these things immediately.
4351;AA024CA;We divers have way more firepower than the infantry. Let's kill some enemies!
1766;AE011BB;Die, you monster!
1519;AC009AA;End of chit-chat, let's go!
1175;AJ010X;I knew this would happen!
2179;AT103BD;Set me free! Set me free!
916;AA064BA;Why did you enlist?
3003;AZ033Q;It's the strongest vehicle ever. Be gentle.
476;AM163BA;Thanks!
6640;AU132CA;Please don't send us on these grave missions, we're done with these expeditions.
1349;AN014BC;I'm counting on you, Captain.
2949;AM144DC;Because the sky is so blue and beautiful.
2115;AO012BA;Damn! My magazine is cracked!
1903;AZ054G;Did you have fun, ground forces?
2343;AA061BD;It's too dangerous. Do you still want to fight?
1377;AB011BB;We're running again?!
819;AP010DD;Destroyed!
945;AA044BC;Do you need support?
3377;AA141BB;Powered exoskeletons were originally a military technology.
1763;AM003V;This is nothing! You won't die!
1457;AL032BC;We took out the last one!
2465;AE166_036;Enemies are holding the launchers! Watch out!
831;AC020AA;Plan X.
2424;AE131_065;It's now or never! Fire at will!
1251;AY010DA;You are my hero!
1610;AO026BE;Reloading! I don't need backup!
1429;AE163_019;FINISH THEM ALL!
2400;AE210_131;The command ship has been moderately damaged!
2694;AEX04_507;These are light barriers! Attacks will be useless!
2100;AM180BC;Because I have something to protect.
977;AM048DA;That won't work!
1268;AEX04_048;Enemy count, five.
2241;AA014BC;We don't accept immigrants on this planet.
1787;AA010BD;I am not trained for this.
2954;AE155_014;This is too much! I can't fight anymore!
16154;AE141_082;The tides of war is ever-changing. Aliens around the world have launched large-scale invasion operations. We managed to make it through, but still, many regions fell into enemy hands. And the remaining force is reaching their limits.
1045;AE210_085;A shield barrier?
4669;AE140_032;Sergeant, I'm glad you're okay. All units have retreated. Thank you very much.
4858;AE121_006;The enemy outpost is protected by anti-air artillery. We can only approach them from the ground.
1307;AA044DD;Are you mentally prepared?
1009;AA034BA;Don't go crazy!
1565;AN002DC;Looks like I can't leave him alone.
3827;AE003_041;Iota-1 is activated. Powered exoskeleton team, engage.
1545;AE002_138;Huh? What the?
1045;AS004BA;STOP THAT!
1251;AG014BE;COMING THIS WAY!
751;AH003BB;Evade!
737;AM106DD;I know!
2232;AF030BA;Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.
689;AM204BD;Really?
1764;AQ008DD;Aaaaaaaaaahhhh
759;AL009DA;YEAH!
831;AH013BD;Is it bad?
2158;AE128_035;We are being attacked by the artillery unit!
1814;AL043BC;Can I be discharged after this mission?
713;AZ010PB;Confirmed.
1035;AM077AC;I can't believe this!
3883;AE127_024;We are done for if this gets out of hand! Stop the monsters before they close in!
3143;AE211_119;Is anybody out there? Anybody?
1401;AH007DA;Check if there's any damage!
1816;AEX04_063;Target exterminated.
1341;AA121BE;I'll kill them all!
2301;AE071BC;NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ALLOWED
2055;AM120BC;You better be sure before you say anything.
3000;AE005_051;That mysterious monster is spitting lava-like substances!
934;AS004AB;ATTACK IT!
2192;AI005DA;Stabilizer confirmed abnormal!
3246;AE135_027;We'll take care of the flying type. You can count on us.
1742;AA127BC;I can't imagine we'll lose.
926;AM104DA;Guess so.
1234;AM050Y;Only you think it that way.
2285;AEX04_692;This is Tiger II, beginning attack!
3073;AE114_063;Show them what the EDF infantry is made of!
1793;AJ008BC;Somebody help us!
1397;AE038BB;IT'S SHOWTIME!
4471;AE171_046;Arcalus got away. Stop chasing it. The mission is over.
1533;AR027BA;The newcomer got chewed up!
977;AM092BB;It's common sense.
1874;AE178_023;The base was ours originally!
2021;AE207_016;Number 11 is gathering the enemies!
1313;AS002FB;AHHHHH!
841;AM020BB;Good job!
628;AE168_021;Copy that!
4869;AE107_012;This is Ranger 3! We're fighting thread-shooting monsters! Two of us got injured!
2151;AA100DD;I'll never get defeated by monsters!
2698;AA131BB;It's hard to control a powered exoskeleton.
1892;AL027DA;Is that all you've got? Too weak.
1707;AZ035J;Civilian, are you alive?
6795;AU122Y;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
499;AY001BC;Thanks.
4098;AE203_010;All backup has been eliminated, even the base.
1466;AM077BC;That's why we're in trouble!
1879;AI008DC;Shock Absorber Condition 4!
2732;AE198_061;Start attacking aliens coming from both sides!
505;AY029BA;Hehe!
2354;AT002BA;It's pulling me away! Save me!
1157;AM187BB;This is freedom.
480;AY050BB;Goodbye!
1812;AE117_024;What the heck are the aliens doing?
1280;AM011BD;Don't let it get to you!
1114;AJ005W;Find the sergeant!
3592;AE199_021;What? You mean they multiply by eating flats and houses?
2776;AZ030Q;Drop to designated coordinates, just get on the vehicle.
1382;AE164_014;The cannons are glowing!
2111;AE011V;Don't hesitate, just pull the trigger!
2034;AA034ZA;Take our sky back from the aliens!
2036;AA043AA;Exterminate the enemies underground!
2062;AT103BA;Set me free! Set me free!
6559;AU172CA;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
685;AM018CA;Very well.
1208;AE110_039;They're dropping monsters!
2051;AA016BB;I'm lucky, so I won't die here.
1387;AE177_017;Enemy has sent out an army!
2185;AE166_030;This is Blood One! Leave them to us!
2805;AE176_021;AFE, move in. Infantry, follow up.
418;AQ001CB;WHAT?!
2156;AE114_041;I can't believe it! They're aliens!
1268;AI004DB;SYSTEM DAMAGED!
19339;AEX02_040;Since the alien invasion, the entire world has been engulfed in flames. Though there are cases of successful killings of monsters, they have all resulted in heavy casualties. The economy has taken its toll as well. More businesses are shutting down, which leads to lower employment rate. There has not been a concrete policy that fights unemployment.
3380;AA108BC;I've always wanted to be a soldier, now my dream comes true.
1806;AI017DA;Today is really not my day!
850;AE179_016;OPENING!
1262;AL030BD;We're invincible.
1116;AE164_022;DRAUNS!
592;AY019BE;Hahaha
1565;AE191_022;We discovered a device!
1252;AE003CB;AHHHHH!
2914;AZ027O;Critical point is reached. Activate the cooldown system.
1512;AC007BD;Let's start the fight soon!
582;AP002X;HIT!
6585;AU142BA;Here still I will fight thee, and less scream, there's no one home to wait for me!
2372;AE066BE;WAHAHAHAHAHA!
840;AP004BC;A clean hit!
1263;AA117BE;The mission is too hard!
7615;AU161Y;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
869;AN012BA;I'll fight with you.
1521;AE211_116;It's calling aliens!
2303;AE191_003;Watch your step! You'll die if you fall!
1173;AY024DC;Mmmm.
2049;AE163_039;Fire at the enemies and save our men!
1055;AA071BA;What's your purpose?
550;AM106BA;WRONG
947;AE194_003;Drones!
2445;AE166_033;The enemy is carrying some large weapon!
1621;AM066W;CAN WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT?!
2421;AEX04_715;Exoskeletons have arrived on scene.
1418;AL021CA;Switch to cooling mode.
1547;AF017DC;We could be spotted once we attack!
1071;AM203BC;That's so!
1802;AEX04_614;Sniper Team, commence operation.
1719;AQ004FD;AHHHHHHH!
6000;AE138_043;The name says it all. In the last battle, they destroyed three powered exoskeletons with the infantry only.
1772;AEX04_436;A web-making monster!
1506;AA022DD;Let's do it elegantly!
1600;AE120_012;It's not a mission for a newbie.
1186;AD005Z;LAUNCH SPEARS!
1501;AY013BE;Thank you! I love you!
1108;AE165_011;Enemy ship down!
1711;AJ013BE;We can't fight without a commander!
438;AR008DA;Boss!
819;AL013DC;Neutralized.
2766;AA014AA;Bite to the end no matter what. That's EDF.
1824;AF018BB;If you fire, they'll see us.
1382;AA023BC;I have someone to protect.
2862;AA025Y;I didn't know that actual fighting takes more time than training.
578;AM019V;OK.
537;AE104_034;FUCK!
1450;AE067BC;Don't get in my way!
1057;AL015BB;All wiped out!
1300;AL021CB;Switch to cooling mode.
3426;AI003W;I misjudged, how could this be?
1165;AD009BE;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
1503;AL009DB;YEAH!
987;AE133_012;Monsters
2199;AE148_018;Look up! More are coming!
1329;AA048DD;Is there someone you like?
1463;AE008BC;GO TO HELL!
2483;AR012AC;Don't bother the dead! Save those alive!
1024;AB014BC;What's the rush?
2133;AE104_001;So, the war has begun.
1115;AY034BE;Ugh.
3401;AE151_006;SHITTY MONSTERS, TAKE MY FLAME!
2210;AE107_042;Have you made up your mind to become a soldier?
854;AM174BC;Let me thank you!
970;AY024BD;Heeeeeh
726;AI001AC;MEDIC!
847;AP005DC;Defeated it!
1051;AA039BA;Are you petrified?
2784;AE145_005;The mothership has established land supremacy!
574;AE006ZA;SHOOT
832;AM070DB;Exactly!
436;AM076AB;WHAT?!
2294;AE159_049;Team 3 reporting. Too many flying types.
6742;AU032DC;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high Soaring, gliding through the endless sky
6756;AU012CB;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs, Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
2004;AE004_059;Did you say, robots?
3047;AI016DC;I'm sorry, I don't think I can make it back.
1004;AZ026I;STOP BOMBING!
1733;AA102DB;We should never lose to fencers.
1435;AY032BD;I'm very sad.
1126;AM024BB;Respect!
1232;AP014DD;Target down!
1494;AE001_028;Maybe something did happen.
2876;AE183_016;Looks like the aliens are really here to stay.
713;AE002DB;YEAH!
1401;AE002_115;This way! Hurry up!
957;AM148BD;IT'S POSSIBLE
7785;AU151X;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
1801;AL012AB;Confirm if we've exterminated them all!
706;AM045DD;I can't.
1042;AG009BE;INCOMING!
1592;AE208_010;Gigantic anchor destroyed!
1517;AE210_044;IT'S ATTACKING US!
1843;AN027BA;So I'll take you as our acting captain.
764;AE117_060;HELP!
1200;AZ036G;Rockets, fire!
1212;AB015BD;MOVE MOVE!
2245;AE179_043;The gigantic unloader is dead ahead!
541;AM022X;Got it!
4589;AE132_026;That'd be useless, since most of them are injured. We'll take care of these ourselves.
857;AE011AB;STAY STRONG!
1100;AR042BA;I'LL REVENGE!
1496;AE012BC;Don't look down on me!
7705;AU171AA;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
2013;AR039BE;I'm dead! My ally is dead!
821;AM017V;Approved
2222;AA027AA;Trust yourselves and trust your superiors.
1036;AM113DC;I'm not interested.
1492;AE103_013;Look, pylons!
2396;AEX02_017;I can still remember your stupid face back then.
2604;AE165_014;You survived this unforgiving onslaught.
1262;AA018BC;Bullets can never hit me.
2017;AE173_002;Not a single person on the streets!
1207;AE014DC;We can win this battle!
1935;AEX04_500;Imperial Drones, incoming!
3149;AE157_013;Damn! Their equipment is better than ours!
1328;AK006DC;The Scout has spotted the enemy!
4921;AE002_151;The rescue team will be here soon. They must be standing by on the ground surface now.
4879;AE148_023;Is this happening around the globe? Can't imagine how bad the situation will be.
1154;AL022BE;Hooray!
4718;AE166_039;Concentrate attacks on a single spot! Destroy their armor to attack their bodies!
1409;AE211_086;What do you mean by that?
1522;AZ014G;Attack target confirmed.
1073;AM215BA;WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
1848;AE004_065;The robots are taking over the city!
1396;AO007BC;Change the magazine!
1740;AM067W;YOU READ TOO MANY COMIC BOOKS!
3603;AE170_016;Yeah, those things could suddenly attack us in the rain from out of nowhere.
832;AY074DB;You're good enough.
1783;AE190_035;Aliens dropping off!
976;AE013BA;WATCH THIS!
34203;AE107_030;Attention everyone. This is the chief commander. We were ambushed by the enemy and suffered great loss. The ravages of war have spread all over the world and are even getting more serious. It is unfortunate that we were heavily stricken by the enemy at our first battle, but we are not lost yet. The most urgent matter at hand is that our people are still in danger. We must pull ourselves together and start our counter-attack. The EDF shall rise again and the time is now!
5044;AA024CB;We divers have way more firepower than the infantry. Let's kill some enemies!
2031;AE159_036;Head for the mountain top! Let's move!
1425;AEX04_360;CONFIRMED! DEROY!
2723;AE170_032;Plan to use the railgun? Alright then.
1125;AM119DD;Tell me the rest!
1836;AEX04_446;Careful! Flying types are approaching!
539;AZ022O;SHOOT!
1586;AN003DA;I have no choice. Come with me.
1800;AE210_099;Someone is taking out the cannons!
2409;AA048AB;Don't just use your eyes — feel the enemies.
2055;AN005BA;I have no choice. I'll go with you.
1207;AN019BA;Let me join your team.
2013;AA026BD;Even in this situation, I feel hungry.
1809;AQ004EA;YEAH!
1165;AT003Y;Cut these threads for me!
1973;AL047BA;I still have some fight in me.
1042;AE161_021;So fast!
3127;AE112_011;Isn't there a way to shoot down the teleportation ships?
1287;AE010BB;I'M AIMING AT YOU!
1238;AE035AB;I'LL LEAVE THE LEFT TO YOU!
1303;AR013AB;It'll be crowded in hell!
2097;AT108BB;I'm caught in the web! Rescue me!
844;AG009AA;We've been found!
756;AG007Y;They found us!
2534;AE144_031;There's another pack of the Flying Type. Watch out!
708;AE005_048;FIRE!
1727;AE014CB;DOGE THEIR ATTACK FIRST!
597;AE132_033;Well done!
1130;AH005DA;I'll cover the wounded!
3134;AEX04_582;Engage the enemy! Blast them away with your shotguns!
1342;AE211_038;Is it omnipotent?
669;AL022AA;We killed him!
5393;AE202_022;This is just a theory, but we think those monsters are there to breed the microorganisms.
3972;AE131_020;Illegal immigration and illicit work. We must evict them
2539;AE178_014;Monsters are coming out from the teleportation anchors!
953;AP023BC;We did it!
2516;AA017DD;Wing divers even have dietary rules!
2257;AE141_116;I heard it's poison gas or something like that.
1543;AG015BB;The fight starts now!
410;AM038Z;What?
1301;AT206DD;Save our partners!
826;AM085BB;That makes sense.
958;AJ001DC;Please send backup!
1020;AZ016J;Commencing air strikes.
2232;AT002BD;It's pulling me away! SAVE ME!
2319;AA107BB;Because I left the security company to enlist.
1128;AM040W;It's common sense.
1958;AG007DA;The enemy is coming at us full throttle!
1789;AA136BE;LEAVE IT TO US, SPENCERS!
6586;AU032AB;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
1644;AE142_011;Did they sneak into the ground?
1370;AF016DA;Is there any attack signal yet?
2749;AE142_027;This earthquake is caused by the monsters down there?
14734;AE202_020;Unfound microorganisms exist in the monster's body fluids. When a monster dies, the fluid starts to spread those microorganisms across the land, which in turn have the ability to dissolve pollutants in the soil and our air.
1253;AP009BE;We hit it! Next!
1813;AE119_026;They're moving underground!
535;AM033BC;Roger!
1960;AI014DA;At this rate, I'm going to fall!
827;AO004ZA;Charging up.
4053;AQ006X;Grrrr on!
920;AM057AB;That's not true!
5323;AE111_047;Civilian, you are stronger and braver than anyone else. You know what to do, right?
1111;AY004BD;I barely escaped.
908;AD011CB;Hold your fire!
669;AY029DC;Hehehe
1146;AI002DB;Output is dropping!
8967;AE129_002;Use the sandstorm as cover to approach enemy base. The enemies will have a hard time detecting you, but at the same time, your vision will be hampered. So be careful.
1379;AH007BD;I WON'T LET YOU DIE!
1421;AC010DB;I will take down the enemies!
1022;AF009X;Can we shoot now?
1047;AS003DB;Help!
3930;AE004_002;Ground units, attack the monsters! The Air Force will handle the mothership!
587;AM040ZA;What?
859;AY042DA;Nice meeting you.
1049;AM057BC;I'll figure out something!
1030;AC002AB;The battle will begin soon!
634;AZ008L;Launch!
605;AQ002DB;Woah!
845;AE149_008;Ready to fight!
1213;AA041BD;I can't fall asleep!
1861;AI013DD;The wings can't hold any longer!
4772;AE160_007;We're small in size. The enemies should have trouble finding us, especially in the dark.
1514;AE181_018;Beat the living hell out of it!
1848;AC026BD;I'M THE ULTIMATE SOLDIER!
852;AP006W;Good kill!
3134;AA035V;The Underground is also a part of Earth, we must protect it!
1165;AG003AA;OPEN FIRE!
777;AL023BC;VICTORY!
2618;AE159_059;This is Scout. We've confirmed a giant flying type.
2313;AE111_034;Incoming large flying saucers!
1191;AN030BC;Wow, it's you!
1847;AE144_003;It's those flying monsters!
881;AH003Z;Defend!
662;AJ017BB;Come here!
881;AY031BD;That's a shame.
1060;AE005_021;IS IT DEAD YET?!
1560;AY009DA;Next time, I'll save you!
1288;AD021DC;Confirmed shooting range.
2134;AE066BA;Mwahahahahaha!
1195;AE141_045;We didn't get all of them?
2876;AZ007L;Airlock opened. Safety device disabled.
1966;AE110_018;They didn't dodge because there's no need!
2109;AE150_008;Make sure you don't shoot your teammate.
2411;AZ015N;Do we really have to use such powerful weapons?
3061;AE118_044;We can't cause damage to it with ground units. Retreat!
1564;AEX04_244;The sandstorm has cleared up!
1650;AA008CB;I can feel the wind.
765;AY068BD;It's alright.
3187;AE070BC;Look closer! We are EDF!
555;AM037DC;Roger!
1766;AA085BE;I hate dark and narrow places.
1003;AB006CA;Let's fly!
1295;AE179_062;ALIENS CONFIRMED!
2780;AN029BC;Is it really okay to let a guy like you to be our captain?
1093;AM030CB;I can't approve!
1801;AH006AC;Look out for enemies! Counter-attack!
1488;AM044X;I thought that was the case!
1027;AM184BA;This is for my lover.
2320;AT106BE;I can't get out! I can't!
1122;AR002CA;YOU WILL PAY FOR IT!
989;AB005BA;I'LL FOLLOW YOU!
1737;AA037BC;Be serious sometimes.
566;AO003BE;Reload!
2343;AE142_040;Retreat! Retreat!
2000;AE105_006;Hey, look! What are those?!
665;AP004DC;Got it!
1339;AE106_020;WE WILL BE WIPED OUT!
1971;AB001BA;AHHHHH!
699;AC020AB;PLAN-X!
749;AH002W;I'll cover you.
989;AP025BE;Took care of one!
3238;AE158_042;But it's the only way to destroy the shield bearers so far.
3394;AE003_020;And don't be afraid, our combat suits are acid resistant!
1701;AE002BB;RAAAAAHHHHH!!!
1074;AE006BA;Watch this!
1542;AQ007CA;AHHHHHH!!!
625;AY023BE;Hahaha
1166;AE032BE;GREAT CHANCE!
745;AM001Z;Don't panic!
1913;AI018BA;It's hurting! I'm done!
1049;AL003BC;E.D.F.
778;AM061BA;I can't do that.
2932;AA130BD;Thanks to the powered exoskeleton, it feels weightless!
1265;AM111DC;Can we change subjects?
689;AM001DC;Hang in there.
406;AB016BE;RUN!
1962;AE133_003;There's danger ahead! I can feel it!
1508;AC021DA;I'll show you my moves!
1447;AM125BE;YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG!
1913;AE002X;TA!
2741;AA128BA;How can we lose with such powerful heavy armaments?
618;AM134DB;Thanks!
670;AM007BA;Don't give up!
3936;AE211_050;We won't stand a chance if we don't figure out the secret to its weapon.
5911;AE112_014;But we do not recommend this. We won't be able to salvage the teleportation ships if we use nukes.
4637;AE176_011;The range of shotguns is short, but it's the perfect weapon for knocking back monsters.
2107;AE188_010;More flying objects headed our way!
2027;AH007AC;Be careful! We're in enemy's range!
1314;AM093BD;This is obvious.
1104;AE131_060;Stop the assault!
1712;AE104_006;The tanks will support the infantry!
1373;AT009BC;I can't get away!
1468;AP008AA;Hit next!
792;AM054AB;No way.
2490;AEX04_015;Right! Coming from the right!
1850;AL042BA;I... I'm alive!
2825;AM007V;You can count on me! I will definitely bring you back!
1573;AE150_020;Teleportation ship down!
771;AM133DD;Thank you.
775;AP017BA;We did it!
3160;AT106DC;I'm not able to move at all!
808;AM004DB;I'll back you up!
900;AE030BE;Leave it to me!
1176;AQ010BD;The armor is broken!
1675;AE182_005;MONSTERS ARE BEING TELEPORTED!
1165;AY046DB;Let's fight together!
3611;AT111DB;I'm stuck in the web! Request for backup!
1171;AE031BD;I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT!
1749;AE003_023;All units, get in position.
961;AE180_026;The monsters are here!
3672;AE112_019;They keep coming, one after the other! The fight will never end!
2132;AS002DB;AAAAAAAAAAAH!
1412;AE103_007;They're giant pylons!
1228;AO011DD;Ready for cool down!
6545;AU162W;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1282;AZ023H;Fire the cannon!
2247;AE128_039;Someone take out the artillery unit!
577;AO001BB;Loading!
6829;AU122DA;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
1479;AA030CA;Be careful about the altitude!
3471;AE207_003;This is gone, too! Re-initiating! I'll take down their missiles!
601;AM062DD;I think so.
1139;AR010BB;He was a great captain!
1740;AE163_003;Fire! Don't let them get away!
897;AM007ZA;Good job!
629;AM081BD;That's right.
1782;AE177_022;Stay out of the way, Spriggans!
3328;AZ008J;Civilian, can you hear me? Tell me the enemy's location.
482;AM032BC;Yes!
6881;AU152BB;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
1714;AA014DD;Watch me dance like a bird!
2408;AE171_035;Good. We've achieved the original goal.
663;AY034DA;Sigh...
2345;AE118_032;This is Bowl Leader! We suffered a great loss!
573;AF002ZA;Quiet!
535;AM201BB;What?!
1985;AK012BC;I've got a bad feeling about this.
2484;AE179_067;The gigantic unloader, bargain!
2018;AA023DC;Plasma drive, output stable.
5233;AE106_033;Civilian, you are pretty good. This time I will definitely take you to a safe place.
3101;AE159_033;Team 1, move across the mountain ahead and approach their nest.
3245;AN029BB;Is it really okay to let a guy like you be our captain?
512;AM014Z;Okay.
1922;AT001CB;UNABLE TO FLY!
714;AN020BD;Aye, Captain!
1511;AE197_034;Are you talking about EDF?
4684;AE204_001;This is Scout. Aliens have brought gigantic monsters with them. This might be a whole legion.
862;AT301CB;Thank you!
828;AF003AC;Let's move closer.
1369;AE010AA;Concentrate your fire!
977;AM063DD;Let's do this!
1628;AJ008DD;We can't keep staying here!
1049;AI012BE;So unlucky!
1618;AT203CB;Let's save the trapped ones!
1631;AE004_057;ALIEN LANDING SHIPS!
4331;AS003W;Oh crap!
393;AQ002AB;Duh!
2087;AL004BE;WOO-HOOO!
3352;AE198_086;Storm One, bargain ready to deploy, board now.
2404;AE196_010;This cannot be! We have to do something!
2015;AL004Z;YEAH!
1254;AY004DC;I barely escaped.
6690;AE202_086;Strategic Intelligence Division, can you hear me? I just want to say thank you for all the help and support.
1439;AN017AC;Looks like we have to fight together.
1753;AA101BE;Really hate to step on the battlefield.
1703;AE144_004;Must be those bird-like creatures.
1888;AT007DB;Attack that thread-spitting creature!
935;AY075BE;I'm having fun.
1403;AL028BD;The enemy is finished.
2145;AE168_029;A Rheneia is spinning its web!
2031;AA032X;We'll take the fight to their turf one day.
3347;AE141_087;It appears to be the main force of the Earth airborne operation.
2118;AZ017J;All bombers, enter the air raid area.
985;AA073BE;It's so dark.
1375;AC004CB;Confirm enemy position.
1437;AM152DC;That's the kind of woman I am.
1470;AE067BD;Don't get in my way!
2318;AT002BB;It's pulling me away! Save me!
667;AM009BC;Don't move!
1950;AA005BC;It's gonna be another real battle today.
1733;AA030BD;Following the orders can't be wrong.
700;AM012DA;Awesome!
2444;AE006_015;All units, retreat. We have to regroup.
2126;AEX04_277;CONFIRMED. TYPE 2 DRONE.
782;AM034W;Can't do.
546;AQ007BA;CRAP!
934;AF025BA;Can we attack now?
2987;AE173_004;Eliminate these drones and recover this region!
1035;AF019DA;They haven't found us yet.
4260;AE157_032;In Australia, a FENCER unit bravely broke through the barrier successfully.
1254;AM173BE;You saved my life!
1309;AM067DD;It's common sense.
1740;AE017Y;I'm in a fight! I need backup!
674;AL020BE;We did it!
1376;AA043DB;Didn't you sleep well last night?
1737;AE110_030;They keep dropping monsters!
1753;AE120_013;Aliens are calling monsters!
562;AM049DA;Forget it!
2878;AT206BB;Don't leave your men behind! Destroy the web!
934;AH009BB;Hold on, buddy!
1894;AG007DB;The enemy is coming at us full throttle!
2141;AE001_050;Guess now you won't get in your own way!
804;AR002BE;CAPTAIN!
995;AP002DD;One killed!
7585;AE129_044;Looks like the aliens can control the monsters to a certain extent. We just found out that they can summon monsters from underground and command them!
1543;AS006AB;OH NO!
2277;AE134_004;Heck, they're jumping monsters again!
1300;AF006DC;Let's draw closer to the enemy.
2034;AE211_001;A silver giant?
1397;AB009BD;They want us to run!
944;AM027V;NEXT TIME!
9531;AE135_015;Monsters that can fly with this speed are extremely dangerous. If they get away, they'll cause lots of damage to other areas. You have to exterminate them all.
3408;AE189_002;People are caught in the webs. Destroy the webs and rescue those people.
4797;AE168_042;The support vehicle will arrive along with AFV. The injured should directly board the vehicle.
2584;AE198_041;Ahhhhhhh!!!!
1091;AE009AC;SHOOT DOWN THE ENEMY!
2218;AO017BB;BULLETS! BULLETS!
1377;AEX04_062;Target destroyed.
1724;AEX04_013;Enemy also coming from the rear!
802;AP001Z;One down.
2244;AE170_028;Railgun? Can you handle it?
1262;AM183BD;This is for my wife.
1184;AF009DD;Haven't been seen yet.
1223;AE180_012;Board the bugger!
1384;AS003X;SAVE ME!
2037;AA027Y;The Earth belongs to us, not them.
675;AE001Z;HUAH!
1431;AB001BD;MWAHHHHH!!!!
2589;AE169_016;Successfully annihilated the giant betatype!
740;AM006DC;Stay strong.
1366;AH012BA;I'll give you some medicine later!
1577;AE119_041;I CAN'T HOLD IT ANYMORE!
653;AM123DB;Thank you.
2274;AE179_034;I'll take the lead. This is my house.
1041;AE168_018;What's the situation?
2824;AE002_122;Don't say that. We'll do our best to protect you.
1078;AH004CB;Cover the injured!
670;AM099BB;Agreed!
1606;AI006BB;Oh no, we need healing!
1831;AA037BB;Be serious sometimes.
2770;AA071DD;Wingdivers are not suited for underground battles.
1442;AD007CB;Maximize the power output!
1452;AD019DD;Switch to attack mode!
863;AM165DC;I don't believe it!
1532;AY036DD;I can't believe it!
5747;AE210_056;The ship that existed in the age of gods, the one that carries God. I finally found it.
830;AE002DD;YEAH!
873;AO002AB;Reloading ammo.
2125;AE158_003;WE HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH THOSE BARRIERS!
6394;AE170_011;The pilot died at the beginning of the battle, and the troops just retreated leaving the railgun behind. That's what I'm looking for.
1340;AN026DD;Don't worry, I'm here.
1260;AR022DC;This is unforgivable.
4935;AE118_033;This is bull leader! Ugh! Uh! Uh! Uh! AHHH!
2161;AC013DA;Plasma Drive, output increases!
1265;AO030BB;I'll change the cartridge!
1156;AM075BC;Easy for you to say!
2417;AE144_016;Infantry unit, protect the surface-to-air missiles.
3499;AE139_011;There's no strategy plan, so just kill all enemies on sight!
1799;AL018V;All units, check your injury!
2054;AD015BB;Pretty close, but still out of range.
1985;AA057AB;Always check on your partner's positions.
1308;AA006DB;Flying is my job.
907;AS001AA;AHHH!
1088;AY008BD;I'm so grateful!
2608;AE179_026;This way! Our objective is down here!
3352;AN009DD;Because there's no commander here, we'll join forces with your team!
1161;AE105_021;Our weapons work!
2029;AN003DD;I have no choice. Come with me!
1227;AE202_006;The skin is too thick!
1023;AC009BB;I can't die.
843;AM077DC;That's what I heard!
2801;AE143_030;Anchors are dropping from the sky! Careful!
2020;AEX04_104;Gullverin Cannon, open fire!
948;AL005AB;We did it!
891;AE191_024;Here's the device!
1673;AEX04_372;Confirmed! New enemy type!
1762;AL001CA;HAAAAAAAAA
1149;AM099DB;That's not true!
382;AM026AB;Yeah.
1341;AC003BD;I'll show you what I have.
442;AF002CA;Quiet.
1416;AA051DA;I have a smart brain.
5188;AE149_010;Their legs are designed with cannons. We should focus on the legs and weaken their attacks.
1834;AE114_044;The aliens have weapons!
1462;AF014AB;Don't shoot. On my command.
2658;AR012BC;Our captain died! We need a replacement commander!
3032;AE141_111;E-D-F, E-D-F!
1871;AA003FC;Aaaahh
868;AA080BC;You'll get lost.
1124;AM048DD;That won't work!
1821;AS006BD;Somebody help!
2401;AL002BD;E-D-F! E-D-F!
586;AE137_005;Copy that!
2177;AN006DD;It's my job to protect civilians.
784;AZ023J;Attack
1531;AE017AC;Watch out for enemies in the back!
588;AM084BC;Agreed.
2562;AA047BB;I can make the best dishes in the world.
1025;AZ014J;Marker confirmed.
2077;AE211_037;Its abilities are uncanny!
1892;AE159_050;Thanks for the backup!
1889;AF015AA;Don't jump the gun! Wait for my order!
1092;AL012W;Eliminated!
1268;AY004BA;I barely escaped.
1032;AEX04_024;Enemy Squadron!
3533;AE144_009;Powered exoskeletons, take care of the enemies near the surface-to-air missiles.
2018;AN002AB;It's our duty to protect civilians.
2394;AA076DD;I can't believe we have to fly in the dark!
1557;AE190_041;Fall back! Fall back!
1910;AEX04_409;The monsters are eating the buildings!
2077;AR007BB;I will avenge our captain!
1898;AJ004X;Are you blind or screwed?
6157;AE202_091;I understand. Fight till the end. That's the least we can do for those who have given their lives.
7753;AU151CB;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
1424;AL003BE;E.D.F.!
854;AR005AA;You alright?
882;AE023AA;ARMSHOT!
1139;AE040AB;WATCH OUT FROM BEHIND!
1394;AS001CA;NOOOOOOO!
1620;AD023DD;Stabilizer, Max Outt!
1865;AT105DB;Ugh! I can't escape!
958;AA056AB;Don't get separated!
1640;AE135_011;Are they shooting darts at us?!
3914;AE103_051;We need to evacuate! Come with me! I'll take you to somewhere safe!
2378;AE207_002;This is GON-1, initiating battle system.
689;AM075DD;You bet!
4028;AE173_022;Countless monsters are hovering above Europe. The situation is hopeless.
8130;AE141_095;Around 5,000 aliens, countless drones and monsters, with the mothership setting up barriers over the sky.
704;AY029BC;Hee hee!
1565;AF002V;Be quiet or we'll be found.
631;AY054DB;Good night.
3017;AA011X;I didn't get much education, but I'm the boldest.
1654;AA080DD;Watch out for the altitude!
3572;AE163_033;The enemies are too fast! The tank cannons can't get a clear shot!
7006;AU022DB;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
6612;AU032BE;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, Soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
1906;AEX04_513;Spotted longleg deroys!
3714;AE159_031;Let's destroy the nearby flying type and secure this area!
3320;AA118BD;I became a soldier only for the pension. I regret it now.
1621;AC014DC;Stabilizer up and running.
462;AM037ZA;Thanks.
2472;AA094BA;I'm not afraid of the enemy, but the darkness.
5045;AE145_004;Now we have both the powered exoskeletons and railguns. I like our odds.
7485;AE146_003;Aircrafts and choppers can't get close due to attacks from the mothership ground units will come for support. So don't give up. You must hang in there
756;AM076Y;Thanks for the help!
1838;AE128_065;What the hell are they trying to do?
1879;AE114_022;Anyway, just take out the monsters!
1642;AM090BE;That's what the drill sergeant said, too.
394;AQ002BE;Ugh!
577;AE143_015;LOOK UP!
4096;AA115BC;I only did training. Now I'm doing the actual fight!
2250;AN005DD;I'll protect you until we leave the battlefield.
1211;AE190_040;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
1877;AE065BC;Whoaaaaa!
626;AP003Y;We hit it!
2567;AE206_024;This is Gon-1, supporting infantry units!
718;AM065DC;I see.
1386;AE114_014;Destroy the monsters!
2578;AEX04_504;Light barriers! It's those shield bearers!
2432;AE186_015;Infantry, cover the powered exoskeletons.
996;AM133BD;Yeah, maybe.
786;AM077X;Thank you!
3288;AE198_036;Barga 5, heavily damaged, can't hold on any longer.
1677;AA042AC;EDF is not afraid of the dark!
1275;AC017DB;Switch to burst mode.
638;AE009DB;This way!
1244;AL031DC;I'll take a rest.
2201;AEX04_666;Spriggan unit, put on a show for us.
1342;AA011BC;Let's get serious today.
1005;AZ013I;Marker confirmed.
1157;AM010BC;Don't be discouraged!
1144;AEX04_107;Bombardment ceased.
7669;AU021DD;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise
712;AM001BB;Hold on!
890;AB007AA;Keep going!
2578;AN001ZA;A civilian? Guess I'll keep an eye out.
1966;AZ013K;This is Phobos, leaving for now.
1298;AA020AA;Don't let your guard down.
3095;AI016BA;Oh no! My eyes are blurry!
1921;AEX04_627;Wingdiver, we're counting on you.
7699;AU141AC;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
5430;AE205_031;We've confirmed 10 motherships. This is the 11th. Mothership 11.
1761;AA046BB;I was a cook before I enlisted.
1099;AL005CA;Woo-hoo!
1125;AN007AA;We're under your command.
1195;AE008CA;Take this guy down!
713;AM095BB;That's right!
2093;AN026BA;Without a commander, I'm troubled.
1140;AEX04_464;THE QUEEN IS COMING!
1054;AF009CA;This is exciting.
1396;AE118_015;No way I'll miss the target!
585;AY054DD;Good night.
2792;AEX02_028;Guess they knew this would happen when they designed these suits!
878;AM036ZA;I'm in your debt.
822;AM203BA;Is that so?
1374;AE131_072;There seems to be a road ahead.
43513;AE112_016;Attention everyone, this is the Chief Commander. The alien attack is still underway. The entire Earth has become a battlefield and people everywhere are in harm's way. Our attack against the alien spaceship remains ineffective and there is nothing we can do for now. But EDF always prevails and until we can launch a full-fledged counter-strike, I hope the ground units can keep exterminating the monsters and protecting our citizens. This is a tough war, but I expect all of us to fight bravely. Do not forget we have defenceless citizens depending on us. We are not only on the front line, we are also the last line of defence.
1132;AD021BC;I'll show it to you.
1430;AC017BE;Don't die, stay alive!
2363;AE117_025;They're definitely breeding monsters underground.
992;AH004AC;Protect the injured!
487;AM156DB;What?
3811;AE151_015;We have confirmed the survivors. We'll take them to meet up with the main force.
1414;AW001ZA;Thank you for saving my life.
1281;AE166_007;Let's do cover the right
3027;AN014DA;What a coincidence! I'm looking for a commander too.
1017;AY066DD;My bad.
1758;AE145_071;These are decoys in the front!
1715;AEX04_339;Type 2 drones incoming!
3480;AA113BC;I heard about the war situation. EDF has a commanding lead!
2712;AEX04_635;This is Fencer 2, engaging now!
870;AM058AB;Check it again!
2335;AA053AB;Take it easy. Your eyes will get used to the dark.
1275;AE159_055;MORE MONSTERS!
3441;AZ033J;It's dangerous to enter the combat area. Don't call us for nothing.
2739;AE183_032;Ha, it's always like this when you're here.
2250;AEX04_629;Wingdivers have arrived. Go rendezvous with them.
1549;AEX04_493;Drones incoming!
1395;AE020DC;BEHOLD THE DANCE OF DEATH!
465;AM163BC;Thanks.
1867;AE153_024;WE'VE ENGAGED THE ENEMIES!
3420;AE114_054;They have mouths, too! They look like they're talking!
2701;AE142_018;Oh, it's you. Give me a hand, will ya?
2610;AEX04_657;This is Spriggan Unit. We've reached the combat area.
622;AF014DC;Shut up!
1392;AE199_027;THEY'RE EATING THE BUILDING!
1392;AM091DA;Don't spread false info.
845;AM115DA;I suppose!
649;AY045BA;Good evening.
3691;AEX02_003;Correction! Everyone alive, get back to base!
2677;AA015DD;With this aerial unit, monsters are nothing.
1142;AA034V;Take a deep breath!
1376;AM019AB;This is what we're trained for!
2209;AT309BB;Thanks to the hero that came to my rescue!
2505;AL007W;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1064;AM162DA;I can't believe it!
1232;AE186_027;Good, keep attacking!
765;AO003BB;Reload!
758;AN020BE;Hi, Captain!
2073;AE136_016;Infantry unit, protect the EMC.
977;AM126BE;Don't get it wrong!
1668;AM004X;We'll give you some medicine later!
931;AK006AB;Prepare for battle!
908;AG004Z;MOVE FORWARD!
1619;AE129_045;I can't believe they can do this!
1608;AR015BA;Report! One man died!
546;AQ001FC;AHHH!
1970;AE105_009;Hey, look! What are those?
2664;AE169_011;There are still other monsters! Annihilate them all!
2683;AE146_027;Aliens found! Prepare to engage!
806;AL017DC;That's great!
1978;AI007CB;Something's wrong with the stabilizer?
3644;AA032BC;If I had known this would happen, I would have done my training seriously.
671;AY002DC;Thank you.
1790;AS014BD;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1347;AM100BD;That goes without saying!
717;AM010CA;AMAZING!
1372;AL018CA;What a weak opponent!
1017;AH003AB;Defend the patients!
3031;AEX04_712;Powered exoskeletons are on the scene. Eliminate the enemy!
2690;AE176_064;The blazer wasn't effective against Arcalis!
1493;AE125_011;Attack the artillery unit!
2968;AS001Y;AAAAAAHHHHH!!!
1885;AF019AB;Steady. The game's on soon.
3421;AA026X;Hey, you've got to ask for our permission first to live on Earth.
1381;AM136BE;That's not so bad, right?
1094;AY036DA;I can't believe it.
2081;AE139_014;Attack the teleportation ships!
1802;AE108_011;Pylons! Again!
626;AZ010K;Fire!
951;AY013DB;I love you.
752;AY026BA;Haha!
2705;AA103BA;I want to be a hero, but it looks like I can't be one.
1916;AA041AA;Keep going, don't be afraid of the dark.
4560;AE004_014;Something's approaching! It's alien flying ships!
4902;AA021BB;I applied to join logistics support missions. Maybe this is my last time on the front line.
391;AM031AC;Fine!
4384;AE002_081;Did the ground unit fall asleep or what? The monsters are crawling all over the place.
1413;AEX04_581;Shotgunner in position!
2354;AF011AB;Let's knock him down quick and clean once we're close enough.
2036;AI008BE;Bring me the medicinal supply!
799;AM097DB;You're wrong!
436;AP004Y;Got it!
7675;AU111BA;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
1120;AE133_040;The eggs are moving!
319;AM202BB;AH!
1043;AZ022G;Good job, civilian!
1737;AE146_028;Damn! We're exposed!
1574;AM128BD;You've got to be kidding me!
2356;AE100_037;Just switch on the light and it'll be fine.
539;AM002DC;You all right?
1157;AT101DD;AHHHHH!
1590;AM139DB;We can never let go of the enemy.
407;AM080DA;No!
1640;AE207_023;Destroy the teleportation anchor!
669;AG002ZA;ATTACK!
925;AZ019H;Fire!
811;AE018BC;I'll back you up!
716;AY039BA;All yours.
1686;AC006BC;I can fight! You can trust me!
753;AEX03_010;Help!
1140;AEX04_724;Barga has arrived!
991;AE005X;WATCH THIS!
1235;AA043BE;Do you think we will win?
528;AP001AB;We hit it!
1429;AA006BD;We must take them down.
1672;AL034BA;I hope this is the final part.
1159;AI004DC;SYSTEM DAMAGED!
1407;AA089DC;Birds can't fly at night!
2433;AE211_125;All of you, hang in there, no matter what.
1610;AM103DD;Better keep it to yourself!
1811;AM040DD;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
838;AM164BA;I appreciate it.
2113;AEX04_208;Defend the powered exoskeleton!
2529;AA015BC;We must crack down on illegal immigrants.
1805;AM090BC;That's what the drill sergeant said too.
782;AM174BA;Let me thank you.
861;AL014CB;You did it!
917;AM050AC;I can assure that!
1184;AS012BA;LET ME DOWN!
1039;AM096BC;You're not mistaken!
2254;AE042BE;Did you see that? I'm unmatched!
2177;AE140_001;It's already a miracle to be alive.
4975;AEX04_728;It's about time you got here. Man, it got real nasty. Why is there a civilian, by the way?
2288;AE110_021;The Air Force is about to strike! Back off!
773;AEX04_151;Missile inbound.
1571;AE153_018;The aliens are descending!
1364;AM185BE;This is for revenge!
1445;AE205_001;How about storm four?
3017;AE170_025;You want me to show you where the rail gun is? No way.
3235;AA126BA;We have weapons as good as tanks! Show them what we have!
543;AM047BD;Roger!
2013;AK003AB;The sensor is responding. Stay on guard.
591;AM047CA;WRONG!
1273;AY017DD;Easy peasy!
2077;AE200_018;Our goal is to get to the mountaintop!
1923;AR011BD;Captain, I won't forget you.
1933;AE176_037;There's also a round monster!
972;AY046BC;Let's fight together.
4150;AE179_004;There's also an elevator built for vehicles. This here is an emergency exit.
2524;AZ002PB;This is the trump card of humankind.
1636;AEX04_338;Red color drones incoming!
2256;AE105_029;There should be laws against the use of battle drones.
1712;AA013ZA;Dodge first. Attack later.
1533;AA053DA;That guy keeps looking at me.
2189;AEX04_592;Rocket launcher team, engage the enemy!
4473;AE110_047;We will call the enemy's transporting technology teleportation from now on.
3061;AE146_007;Okay, let's do this, but be careful.
1641;AA022DC;Let's do it elegantly!
1544;AE002_080;Proceed cautiously.
1006;AEX04_023;Enemy over there!
924;AP005X;I'LL CLEAN IT!
7831;AU131BD;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1559;AE119_010;Monsters are ambushing us!
2530;AA070BC;What do you add to your sunny side up eggs?
1094;AG002BB;They found us!
1054;AE185_005;THEY'RE TOO FAST!
1721;AE180_009;Reboot Baga's system.
1548;AH008DD;Report to the medical center!
1363;AE011W;Attack the flanks!
3315;AEX04_432;Bullet shots won't kill them. What's going on?
1566;AE174_001;THE ROBOTS ARE APPROACHING!
1809;AF007BD;Enemy in sight. Let's attack!
1726;AE149_002;The robots keep increasing!
1314;AA042Y;It's so stuffy in here.
1793;AE180_025;The monsters are approaching the base!
3106;AL002AC;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2252;AE168_014;The fog has cleared up a bit. It's better now.
535;AQ001EE;AHHH!
1694;AE128_028;THEY'RE DROPPING ALIENS!
1276;AS002FA;WAHHHHH!
7565;AU021AB;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
2776;AE176_010;Don't worry, the AFV will come to our support.
1321;AC016DC;Switch to reckless mode.
2503;AE004_044;Show them what the EDF infantry is made of!
1717;AD005Y;Calm down, still too far.
2374;AC022BD;I'm okay. I'm not shaking.
697;AB007AB;KEEP GOING!
2585;AA002BE;This is why I became a soldier. Leave it to me.
2470;AI014DC;At this rate, I'm gonna fall.
1223;AK006AA;Prepare for battle!
507;AM043DA;No way.
1198;AM154BA;I have to believe that!
2918;AE147_002;We did everything we could to stop the mothership.
1322;AE122_007;WAHHHHHH!!!!!
1383;AA005CB;Plasma Drive, check!
3896;AE121_066;Don't let those drones spread out! Shoot down the drones as you fall back!
1666;AA024DB;Plasma Drive, Condition 1.
897;AM070BB;No way!
971;AE105_008;ARE THEY ENEMIES?
617;AE173_023;Damn it.
2031;AE131_008;What exactly will be ahead of us?
669;AM041CB;Yeah, sure!
734;AM028AA;Approved!
495;AM075AB;OH
1591;AE109_003;I can fight no more!
1940;AE018AC;We're the strongest! Fire!
1470;AM181BC;This is for honour.
1321;AE005_049;IT'S ROLLING TOWARDS US!
2743;AE126_019;Very impressive for a newbie.
1017;AT107CA;I'm stuck here!
1864;AE133_041;Monsters are coming out from the eggs!
4436;AE130_034;How is this possible? It can blow up a building with one shot!
2152;AEX04_236;The fog has cleared, let's go!
839;AE179_033;Moving on!
1479;AM190BB;Because I want money and fame?
448;AM017Z;NO
3372;AF001X;Sweet. The enemy is surprisingly careless.
787;AA006AC;To as planned!
1763;AC004DD;Sensor is detecting enemies!
2410;AZ046G;Attacked designated area as requested.
1357;AEX04_403;Hey! A red one!
875;AE025AA;BODYSHOT!
1611;AL041BC;We can call it a day, can't we?
903;AN007AB;We're under your command.
1685;AT001BE;AHHHHHH!!!
1852;AE108_001;It's raining hard.
1890;AC016AB;We're in the Combat Zone! Watch out!
3529;AE104_012;All we can do is fight! Protect the civilians!
1587;AO006AC;Out of bullets! Reloading!
2242;AEX04_694;This is Tiger Team, engaging the enemy!
2465;AO019BE;The ammo doesn't come out! The gun's jammed!
1869;AN028BD;You? To be our captain?
1360;AL003Y;E-D-F!
1246;AM143BC;Can we change this subject?
1311;AE019V;I'LL BREAK THROUGH!
3549;AE192_014;The eggs have hatched at the same time. Get out of there now!
6470;AE001_012;What you're wearing is a powered exoskeleton. It has great strength, so you can move the cargo all by yourself.
5029;AE180_036;You've made it. Aerial troops have arrived. They will exterminate the remaining enemies from above.
4325;AE130_007;The sniper team is behind us. Join up with them and fall back to where the heavy tanks are.
1636;AA004DD;I'll fly faster next time.
2786;AT306BC;Did you destroy the web? Thank you for saving my life!
2166;AL037DA;I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
5570;AE197_035;Maybe that's why we angered the primers. We should have never found out about their existence.
890;AM013BC;You're great!
2460;AE194_023;Infantry, provide Barga fire support.
1653;AM090BA;That's what the drill sergeant said, too.
947;AE149_003;They aren't moving.
1311;AN022DA;I will follow your instruction.
1440;AE128_056;What is the line of defense doing?
1622;AC022BA;I'm okay. I'm not shaking.
350;AE001DC;HA!
993;AM017AB;You're doing great!
1200;AA033BD;Come back alive!
713;AM040Y;I thought so.
1752;AY065DD;I will never do that again.
1210;AR012DD;An ally fell!
1365;AL040BC;We've done our part, right?
2248;AT001W;SOMEONE KILL THAT THREAD SPITTING THING!
852;AM053BB;Leave it to me!
1381;AE111_035;It's the end of the world!
2112;AN006DB;It's my job to protect civilians.
2677;AE135_008;Those bastards brought in a new type of monster!
1646;AA029CA;Enjoy flying into the night!
2117;AEX04_276;Confirmed. Red colour drone.
2580;AE119_027;They're coming! A large group of them!
1199;AZ015I;Attack site confirmed!
1041;AY026DA;Ha ha!
693;AM021AB;You're good!
1702;AD001DB;The enemy is outside the range!
1645;AE162_028;We almost got Arceus!
821;AM132BB;Is that so?
2580;AT308BE;Thanks for saving me. Oh, it's you!
5956;AE112_040;If we can shoot down this teleportation ship, we will finally see a ray of hope in this war.
534;AE002ZA;Yeah!
333;AY037BC;Hi!
1122;AR021DA;We must revenge!
1717;AEX04_406;GREEN MONSTERS!
1533;AE129_016;THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE SKY!
3868;AA030X;Can you believe it? There are people trying to see if the monsters are edible.
1262;AE114_067;CROSSFIRE!
2512;AY012BA;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
3104;AE124_016;This fight will go down in history.
1335;AC010BA;I will take down the enemies!
1195;AJ008BE;Somebody help us!
2037;AD004DC;We'll launch the attack once they get into range.
2138;AE105_003;Is it a new weapon made by another country?
1888;AE167_002;THAT ANCHOR IS DROPPING DOWN!
985;AE190_036;MY ARM IS HIT!
771;AB001CB;Let's go!
2007;AE004_038;More aliens are landing on the ground!
3735;AE163_018;They must be desperate! It's too late to cry for help!
2141;AA098BD;Let me breathe the air outside.
1490;AR005BC;Captain, hold on!
1976;AT308DB;Be gentle next time you save me, okay?
3005;AE119_001;Once we're back to the base, I'll buy you guys a good meal.
1188;AP011BC;I took one down!
805;AM042BD;No problem.
696;AM155DC;Really?
688;AA041DB;Are you shaken?
1136;AG009DA;The enemy is coming!
1982;AEX04_633;Spencer! Engaging now!
1743;AA092BB;The enemy must be hiding somewhere.
1193;AD013AB;All ready to fire!
1908;AT302AB;Did you destroy the net? Great job.
617;AH002V;DODGE!
1441;AE145_060;ENEMIES COMING FROM THE RIGHT!
2935;AE004_008;Do not fear, shoot down the flying saucers!
1844;AE131_010;There's something deep inside the cave!
1177;AM083DB;You're completely wrong.
3753;AT109DB;This is Wing Diver! Request for support!
1018;AO022BE;Is it got jammed?
1950;AE001X;RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!
1591;AE001_035;Fire! Fire!
2324;AL007AA;EDF EDF
1769;AA069DA;We can barely fly underground!
1553;AA022DA;Let's do it elegantly!
2737;AN006V;Hey newcomer, don't worry, I'll protect you!
2102;AA005BA;It's gonna be another real battle today!
754;AM158DB;What's this?
4622;AE208_008;Too many enemies. This, this is not going well.
1282;AE141_011;Deployment completed!
3762;AE171_024;The big anchors pose a big threat to us. Destroy them immediately.
1149;AM119BB;Just you wait.
3901;AA126BD;We have weapons as good as tanks! Show them what we have!
4944;AE112_045;This is Fencer! We'll cover the attack team! Leave the monsters to us!
1279;AM103DC;You better keep it to yourself!
1178;AM004Z;Take down the enemy!
6710;AU132W;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
2204;AE177_038;This is Scout. There's monsters in the sky!
1015;AM092BD;It's common sense!
2346;AN006BB;You're only a civilian, but you're brave.
1865;AA012X;I dreamed that I became a Commander.
592;AM021V;YES!
1027;AY032DD;I'm sorry.
1265;AO017BD;BULLETS! BULLETS!
1627;AY020BE;Ahahahaha!
2191;AA026Y;It's all ruined and crumbling everywhere.
1375;AE153_011;Next 5, to the right!
1433;AE146_057;You saved me again!
2418;AE129_013;That alien is controlling those monsters!
886;AM022BD;Genius!
1391;AE014BD;TAKE THIS!
2181;AE179_039;Did the aliens attack the base because of it?
971;AM032W;Maybe next time.
2103;AE191_028;We've got something! A large unit!
1999;AE186_037;The fight continues, keep attacking!
973;AE181_003;Looks like it made it!
1156;AE156_008;Rescue the survivors!
1287;AA073BD;It's so dark.
5298;AE001_011;Our job today is to move cargo. We're gonna move the cargo from the basement to the ground floor.
1322;AL025BC;It was the last one, right?
3584;AA019DA;It's safe in the sky. There are monsters everywhere on the ground.
1129;AE153_012;Next three, copy that.
625;AM015AB;That's it!
3203;AY011DC;EDF doesn't leave its men behind. It's for real.
2206;AEX04_564;You've got backup. rendezvous with them.
1440;AE192_008;Is the Mother Monster calling them?
882;AE186_017;Attack the nest!
2100;AE004_083;Back off, or we'll be annihilated!
2715;AE200_014;Damn it! Can't believe they got the better of us!
2893;AE131_053;Wait here. The reinforcements will catch up with you soon.
2419;AE191_004;Don't fall! Proceed cautiously!
1852;AE181_010;Storm One, board the bargain.
2015;AM010DC;Such wounds won't stop you from flying!
1143;AY035DB;So sad.
1672;AE210_071;The cannons have locked onto us!
1725;AE002_052;Damn, they're flanking us!
680;AM043V;Thank you!
1758;AE159_018;I didn't expect there'd be so many!
965;AE176_004;We'll take the lead!
4571;AE153_045;Next two! Damage critically!
1057;AM069DA;You don't have to tell me.
7184;AE182_012;The Big Anchor is a terrifying weapon. We need the help of the Air Force to destroy it. Air raiders, get us the coordinates for the air raid.
1608;AF014AA;Don't shoot. On my command.
1967;AE188_006;Don't let them pass! Shoot them all down!
751;AM014CA;Impressive!
914;AE141_013;Fire!
1944;AN003CB;Civilian! Let us help you.
566;AM055DA;Can't do!
891;AE024AA;LEG SHOT!
1760;AO011BE;Not good! I'm out of ammo!
1301;AA095BA;Are giant creatures edible?
821;AS001FB;NOOO!
1349;AK009AC;We still have work to do!
2046;AM010DA;Such wounds won't stop you from flying!
1887;AA068BB;Why did you take a mission like this?
495;AM045BA;Yes sir!
957;AE176_014;FIRE!
2368;AE004_063;First aliens, and now a robot army?
3777;AE003_036;This is Iota 1. Activation sequence has reached final phase.
5849;AE112_020;Now that the attacks by the new types failed, the only thing we can do is keep killing monsters.
1250;AM138DD;Because I'm a fighter!
201;AB008DD;HUT
2046;AE022BC;You shall not pass!
731;AH001Z;Take cover!
896;AE006AB;SHOOT!
1163;AR014DC;One diver died!
682;AY002DB;Thank you.
1732;AEX04_298;CONFIRMED DEATH QUEEN
3360;AA103BB;I want to be a hero, but it looks like I can't be one.
1013;AA079DC;I don't want to walk here.
1970;AA032W;I don't need a plan after promotion.
1475;AE181_008;But he never had any training!
1037;AEX04_188;Get down from here!
1015;AA038W;Why did you enlist?
671;AY050DC;Goodbye.
7672;AU121CB;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
6796;AU162Y;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample of foes day and night
2358;AE119_033;The powered exoskeletons will stay behind!
879;AL023BA;VICTORY!
1451;AC015DB;Activate the shock absorber.
620;AE006CA;Shoot!
3797;AZ024PA;General Headquarters are afraid of this power, so they sealed it.
663;AM048BB;Understood
1305;AO030BC;I'll change the cartridge!
522;AP003V;HIT!
1379;AEX04_497;A new type of drone!
3229;AE004_084;FROM BEHIND! THE FLAKING FROM BEHIND!
795;AE142_028;Earthquake
926;AI011BE;We need rescue!
2936;AZ023PA;Get burned by the fire of hell and die!
1951;AF020BA;Don't get too close or you'll be exposed!
1352;AE001_020;Okay, let's continue.
920;AS004BE;STOP THAT!
5493;AE133_037;These giant monsters will be called Mother Monsters from now on. We think they laid the eggs.
1165;AE039AB;Be careful!
562;AL021AB;IT'S DONE
4092;AA132BE;But with a trained body and a parrot exoskeleton, it's not a problem.
5209;AZ029PA;No! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! No! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
1261;AE115_009;We're completely surrounded!
6728;AE134_017;If they can fly, they can expand their range drastically. We must wipe them out as soon as possible to prevent damage from spreading.
2357;AF022BE;Don't do anything before the captain fires.
2642;AZ026J;End of Airstrike. Leave the combat area for now.
2362;AE011Z;DAAAAAAAH!
1005;AE167_016;Attack the anchor!
1475;AC015BA;Looks like the fight will be violent.
2740;AE135_002;This is bad! They're coming one after another!
2284;AL013Z;The game is up. Boring.
2814;AE140_014;The Monster Army is heading towards this area.
1062;AE131_027;Monsters
759;AM034Z;Good job.
443;AP001DB;Hit!
622;AQ004AA;Ugh!
1451;AQ014BB;AHHHHHHHH!
1817;AI018BE;IT'S HURTING! I'M DONE!
1055;AG014BC;COMIN' THIS WAY!
740;AP002AC;We got one!
6252;AE132_006;Our mission is to secure this cave for the reinforcements. We need to wipe out the monsters while moving forward.
1625;AE004_006;Flying saucers approaching!
7670;AU141X;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
1459;AE123_010;THE ALIENS ARE LANDING!
544;AQ002EE;OOOH
1145;AL005BD;Yeah!
879;AE044BC;Go for the left!
2056;AC015AB;It's just a tiny mistake. You die.
787;AO003BD;Reload!
2747;AN001AB;A civilian? Alright, I'll protect you.
746;AM017DA;Good job!
1489;AE133_022;We must investigate it!
1742;AG015BD;THE FIGHT STARTS NOW!
1304;AL004BD;WOOOOO!
743;AH015BA;ARE YOU SHOT?!
1224;AE003Z;GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!
1546;AM027BA;YOU DESERVE MY PRAISE!
1371;AA042V;Proceed carefully.
1248;AQ005EB;AHHHH!!
840;AP006X;We did it!
769;AM131DB;Thank you!
1613;AE051BA;NOW ATTACK THE ARMS!
1426;AA080DC;Watch out for the altitude!
1701;AT305CB;You destroyed the net. Well done.
1124;AM053AB;That's not true.
1534;AA095BB;Are giant creatures edible?
2058;AV001X;Oh no! Someone is caught!
2172;AF005AA;Now! The enemy didn't notice!
2152;AT207BC;Help your allies destroy the web!
1579;AG005BD;The enemy's coming this way!
1578;AE017BD;I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD!
966;AE043BA;GO FOR THE RIDE!
1535;AM094BC;You don't need to point it out.
3642;AE118_040;Bastards! It blasted the tank armor off like it was nothing!
1557;AEX04_285;Confirmed. Tadpole.
2260;AA087BA;I don't want to fight those things in a place like this.
1182;AE176_006;We'll defeat the enemy!
4465;AE105_071;The drones will hunt us down sooner or later. If we want to live, we must fight back!
2072;AE161_003;This is the new monster species!
1773;AM103BB;THAT'S WRITTEN IN THE BOOKS!
1352;AA084BD;Can't see without light.
1223;AM082DA;It's not like that.
768;AE110_016;No damage?
818;AE002_083;Monsters
588;AF001AB;Stay calm.
968;AP014DC;Target down!
1042;AK011BC;Are there more enemies?
925;AY056BB;I'm outta here.
2420;AE036BE;I'LL MAKE SOME JUICY STEAK OUT OF YOU!
1362;AE017V;SURPRISE THE ENEMY!
2149;AE143_032;This is just too much! We can't handle this!
1473;AL022DD;I must save the energy.
1457;AI021BE;It's just a scratch!
2965;AA073DC;So here we are, underground.
1309;AJ003DB;Isn't the backup here yet?
1352;AY009BC;Next time, I'll save you.
460;AM060AC;Thank you.
2429;AE148_020;The enemy sent out mobile weapons again!
774;AY026DC;Haha
3238;AE063BB;It's too strong! That's not what I was told!
1214;AA063AB;We are the strongest!
857;AM108BC;That's not right.
848;AY075DB;I'm having fun.
1773;AC006BD;I can fight. You can trust me.
6838;AE139_022;Sergeant bad news. There are countless monsters approaching. They're probably summoned by the enemy ships
1163;AC005CB;Detect the enemies!
514;AY054DA;Good night.
2146;AE143_040;It's teleporting two types of monsters!
807;AN011BC;I'll defend you.
2079;AL024DC;Landing. Machine is normal.
690;AP019BC;How is that?
991;AM132BD;Is that so?
435;AM202BA;Huh?!
1463;AA136BA;Leave it to us fencers!
3328;AA024BB;I've got some juicy steak. I'll cook some tomorrow.
2786;AA085BB;I hate dark and narrow places.
2068;AN004V;Hey newcomer, I'll cover you!
1818;AT109BA;Over here! I'm over here!
714;AM052DB;No way!
1094;AM044V;Let me thank you!
2508;AEX04_448;IT'S A NEW FLYING AGGRESSOR VARIANT!
1471;AM086X;It looked like easy money.
2178;AC014BA;The enemy is near. I'll take care of it.
2669;AI004ZA;The system is still on! I can keep fighting!
1943;AZ004N;Target coordinates confirmed.
1601;AE200_004;BREACH THE LIGHT BARRIER!
1182;AA036AC;We can only move on.
7623;AU131X;Fight, you turn into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1522;AE175_022;All queens eliminated.
623;AH003DC;Hold on!
1450;AM077BD;That's why we're in trouble!
1827;AA026AA;We are invincible soldiers.
2592;AA100BB;I'm unlucky. I will certainly...
2073;AL045BD;Bootcamp is nothing like this!
1706;AT204BA;Don't give up! I'm coming to save you!
674;AM055DB;CAN'T DO!
6480;AE160_011;If we want to win, we'll have to use our small sizes to our advantage. Sneak up and beat them. That's our strategy.
4461;AE138_054;It doesn't matter if we break formation, let's form a line and show them what we've got!
1226;AE199_001;No sign of hostiles!
734;AL022AB;We killed him!
1470;AE129_003;Take out the monsters on sight.
536;AE001DA;Woah!
1915;AEX04_430;Their threads are like steel wires!
1405;AB003BD;MOVE FORWARD!
1384;AA084DB;I hate dark places.
667;AM096DB;No!
2433;AE002_040;They must be busy prepping the rescue teams now.
834;AB003AA;Let's go!
508;AQ002AA;Ugh!
2230;AA069AA;Believe in powered exoskeletons!
1481;AY077DA;Hey, we're buddies!
689;AY058BB;I'm sorry.
391;AY037BB;Hi!
1529;AE184_011;It's like a living barrier!
1365;AEX04_296;Confirmed king.
1291;AA023BB;I have someone to protect.
1930;AE145_051;They look disgusting!
1158;AB002BA;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
1557;AS003Y;NOOOOO!!!!
883;AM057W;Yeah, maybe.
5807;AE146_031;It's you! Listen, our guys are hiding in the building, waiting for rescue. Let's go get them!
6720;AU162BD;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
957;AM063DB;Let's do this.
1795;AZ003PA;System repair complete.
2077;AE159_032;Destroy the flying type around!
1834;AM179BD;Because I can't keep myself out of this!
2511;AA002BD;This is why I became a soldier. Leave it to me.
4444;AE211_056;It's hard to believe, but this being is capable of creating energy at will.
837;AM032AB;I can't approve.
847;AA007AC;Clear the mission!
720;AE162_022;Arcculus!
2339;AE113_025;Did the monsters dig an underground tunnel?
289;AQ002FC;Woo!
2201;AE159_024;I think we'll be exterminated by them!
1654;AA048BB;No one can beat me in poker.
3138;AE211_054;Telekinesis is the only reasonable explanation.
1470;AE207_001;Enemy robot incoming!
1341;AE103_045;They are crashing down here!
1338;AE211_142;Storm One!
349;AM019CB;Do it!
3255;AE129_047;If the operation succeeds, we will gain a tactical advantage.
1117;AR016DD;Someone fell!
2876;AF020BC;Don't get too close, or you'll be exposed.
884;AM115DB;I suppose.
1586;AJ002DD;Send backup! Hurry!
1148;AM079AA;I can't believe it!
1951;AE163_034;Take a good aim! They're fast!
3790;AEX02_016;Me too. After that, I dream of being crushed by a tower all the time.
641;AM171BC;I'm grateful.
1908;AE019BD;HEY! NOOOOOOO!
1720;AE134_010;Destroy the teleportation ships.
2309;AA087DB;I might go crazy before I beat the enemy.
4257;AE115_011;It's too hard to deal with all of them at once. We have to take them out one by one.
2062;AE189_005;It's shooting threads! Careful!
3909;AE210_013;I can't believe we're all that's left. Hilarious.
3361;AE141_036;It's okay to take a few hits, as long as we can take out the cannons!
6237;AE148_028;The robots landing across the world have created devastating damage to many regions. If this goes on...
1378;AE161_028;NOT AGAIN!
4287;AE103_031;Damn! I was about to travel abroad next week. Just my luck.
2336;AE120_009;This mission is quite difficult for a newbie.
777;AK001CA;Here's the enemy!
1251;AM113BE;And you really think so?
2621;AI008CA;If anything happens to me, take care of my family.
1871;AE003_032;And there are monsters everywhere!
1103;AC001AC;Everyone stay alert!
6842;AU032DA;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
732;AM075DB;You bet!
1364;AY009DC;Next time I'll save you.
1234;AEX04_410;A LITTLE MONSTER!
2794;AT105BC;I can't move! Somebody help me!
1030;AY055BB;I'm going to sleep.
1302;AA004EC;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
994;AM049BB;Sir, yes sir!
1894;AE114_058;Fall back! Fall back!
2374;AE104_047;Destroy the pylons! Attack the top part!
2619;AT206BE;Don't leave your men behind! Destroy the web!
13333;AE109_027;Attention everyone, this is the Chief Commander. I have an important announcement to make. The identity of the hostile forces is presumed to be an extraterrestrial civilization.
1459;AA028AC;Stay alive no matter what.
1058;AC016BC;It's almost my turn.
2758;AEX04_588;We've called for the shotgun team. They will be here any second.
1789;AK020BA;Enemy responses spotted!
4867;AE175_011;We presume the aliens have summoned the queens and together they will build a giant nest.
854;AM053W;YOU'RE WRONG!
1709;AE188_007;Here they come! Take aim!
2086;AQ015BD;GOOOOOOO!!!
2456;AY011BD;EDF doesn't leave men behind. Ever.
626;AL009W;Clear!
2266;AE006_004;Flying saucers are coming out from the mothership!
1901;AM010DB;Such wounds won't stop you from flying!
639;AQ002EB;AHHH!
1997;AE177_029;Enemies confirmed! On the way!
980;AP006DB;Direct hit!
2069;AE174_032;Long-legged Deroi destroyed!
2208;AO013BB;I'm changing the magazine! Support me!
1058;AJ004DC;We lost our commander!
697;AE100_018;Good call.
1794;AE131_012;Did the monsters dig this tunnel?
1728;AL024BE;Victory is ours!
273;AP001DC;Hit!
3372;AE211_088;But we've already sent in everyone we've got.
848;AK003X;There are more?
1002;AM003AA;Take a deep breath!
2414;AA027V;Fight to the end! There is no other way!
1503;AE163_004;It's payback time!
1489;AEX04_422;WATCH OUT FOR THEIR THREADS!
1357;AA031AB;You get paid to do your job.
1183;AJ009BA;Let's stay here and fight!
607;AP001BC;We hit it!
562;AM052CA;Thank you.
1694;AE163_014;The aliens are howling!
1806;AA010DD;My body feels light today.
1228;AR036BE;Ken got chewed up!
1598;AM084DD;You're not helping at all!
1835;AEX04_501;SHIELD BEAR'S INCOMING!
1118;AP015DA;Pre-eliminated!
1086;AL009BD;Gwaahhhh!
2281;AE210_050;Number 11 is the enemy flagship.
874;AY015DC;I'm back.
1108;AC005V;Prepare to engage!
999;AY010BA;You're my hero.
2430;AEX04_716;Empowered exoskeletons engaging hostiles.
4562;AE176_044;AFE failed to cope with the flying type. Infantry unit, take over the job.
2233;AE200_027;Great! Have you destroyed the shield bearers?
2010;AQ006Y;D A
925;AB006V;LET'S RUN!
1839;AO007AB;Reloading! Back me up for two seconds!
2490;AE116_014;Dreadful beast masters!
1142;AM031DD;Sir, yes sir!
4048;AZ012N;This is barren land. Is the guiding to targets successful?
1261;AE185_020;THIS IS INSANE!
676;AZ013PB;There it is.
999;AM039DC;Sir, yes sir!
1912;AE166_021;The enemies are heavily armed!
975;AEX04_075;Commencing air raid.
1553;AT201BE;Oh no! Someone is caught!
909;AM159BD;Thank you, sir!
1320;AEX04_169;Defend this bridge!
2301;AT207BD;HELP YOUR ALLIES! DESTROY THE WEB!
1629;AN031BA;It's my pleasure to meet you!
732;AE015BE;How's that?
647;AF001AC;Stay calm.
3680;AE197_028;Thousands of years? They've been here on Earth so long ago?
4294;AE206_022;Just two. Gone one. Good luck.
2270;AE117_011;Don't get terrified and run away.
1483;AK004DB;ANIME REACTION DETECTED!
1790;AE174_024;There's also the short-legged type!
859;AM003DC;I'll go save you!
637;AY059BC;Pardon me.
2272;AL008X;E D F
7790;AU161BD;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now, cause not a soul was spared
1623;AE114_040;SOMETHING IS COMING OUT!
2606;AE139_015;We destroyed a teleportation ship!
2366;AT305BC;I'm free! It's all thanks to you.
913;AE202_089;I was just joking.
1797;AI006AA;I'm injured! Cover me!
3295;AA055DA;A pilot who is too beautiful to look at? That's me.
7602;AU131DD;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1751;AZ003I;Artillery, reloading complete.
1426;AE001BA;WAAAHHH!
816;AM002W;Hold on!
749;AT005DC;I'm pulled in!
870;AE026BC;NOW!
2015;AE174_013;THERE ARE THINGS FALLING FROM THE SKY!
2189;AG007DD;The enemy is coming at us full throttle!
2562;AA001CB;Immortality is ours, my wing divers!
1802;AA081BC;The enemy is hiding in the dark.
1484;AA083BB;We're not lost, are we?
1105;AM104BB;That's what I heard!
1615;AA037AC;No retreat! No surrender!
3905;AEX04_263;The drones can detect enemies throughout night and day. Be careful!
4420;AE198_072;A single one of them can destroy an entire city! We are no match for it!
752;AM003Y;Hang in there!
2448;AN017BE;A commander is required for the mission. Thank you.
1134;AM078BC;Let's talk about it later!
1723;AT104DA;I can't get out!
2190;AE129_060;We haven't finished setting up the bombs!
793;AY002DD;Thank you.
448;AY037BD;Aye.
1492;AC007AA;Safety device disabled.
528;AE003DC;AHHH!
1473;AE128_048;Entering the combat area!
1036;AM127DA;Thank goodness.
1054;AN013BE;Please take me with you!
1887;AE210_079;THEY'RE CHARGING A PLASMA CANNON!
1669;AS006BC;SOMEBODY HELP!
2422;AA082DB;I should have worked harder on my night flight training.
2748;AO006X;I'm out of bullets! Support! I need support!
1263;AR022DA;This is unforgivable!
4221;AE176_043;The AFVs can't do it themselves! We need powered exoskeletons as cover!
2681;AT010BC;Do something to take down the thread spitting thing!
2443;AE198_082;Another Barga unit will be dropped on the battlefield.
955;AM057DA;Just quit it!
999;AG005ZA;The enemy's here!
454;AE202_011;What?
1415;AE002_062;Do you mean the robot-like things?
2425;AF012BA;Sweet. The enemy is surprisingly careless.
8248;AE118_007;The attack on the mysterious monster Urgenus has failed. Urgenus is on the run. This area is on top of the escape route.
767;AB004DB;Let's move!
1687;AL032BE;We took out the last one!
741;AM039CB;That's right!
2291;AT105BE;I can't move! Somebody help me!
868;AE010DC;KEEP THE SPEED!
2853;AEX04_071;Fighters incoming! They will blow the enemy to pieces!
1108;AG008AA;GET STARTED!
955;AE159_016;ADVANCE!
371;AB002DB;HA!
914;AM051BA;Hooray!
408;AM160DC;WHAT?!
2578;AA050DB;For a soldier, the most important thing is the brain.
1068;AY005BD;I owe you my life.
2698;AT007DA;Attack that thread-spitting creature!
1076;AR006AC;Hold on! Get up!
990;AF017AA;Check the equipment now!
1062;AE021AB;Take aim at the left!
1089;AC008DD;It's our turn!
1245;AS006FC;Help!
6956;AE123_029;All negotiations have failed. It's not that we can't express ourselves, it's that they never wanted to talk in the first place.
4084;AE206_018;It isn't running away. Maybe it wants to witness our demise.
2044;AEX04_452;NO! THEY'RE GOING TO CRUSH US!
2438;AZ008G;Hey, civilian! You know where the enemy is?
1668;AE191_005;What sort of machinery is that?
1330;AE002_129;You have some talent!
4953;AEX04_074;Commencing air raid in three, two, one. Air raid commencing.
959;AM011BA;Don't let it get to you!
3320;AA054BD;You didn't expect to do such a cool thing as protecting the Earth, did you?
4553;AE198_007;Noble, inform all bargain units. Detachment initialized. Brace for impact!
2672;AE002_107;You gotta be kidding me! I don't wanna die like that!
1794;AE019AB;Show them the power of EDF!
2346;AE132_013;It'll be the end of you if you're on your own.
1386;AZ017H;Fire at will!
1024;AS008BE;HELP ME!
662;AM034BA;Understood
2420;AE169_002;They're the beta type. Very hard to deal with.
968;AM012DB;Awesome
717;AM133BA;Yeah, maybe.
579;AQ003Z;AHHH!
993;AM059AA;DON'T BE SILLY!
2742;AE111_016;So there's no way to take down those large flying saucers?
1156;AE016BE;Swallow this!
2230;AE173_001;We might be too late.
602;AE002_112;Damn!
2610;AL012Z;They're all dead? How uninspiring.
1169;AE140_013;The enemy's approaching!
5556;AE128_032;Looks like the enemy is focusing their attack and trying to break through this area, so hold your ground!
1988;AA053BD;Have you ever wondered why this would happen?
4609;AZ011G;This is DE-202. Civilian, are you aware of the enemy's location?
1533;AE135_019;IT'S THE FLYING TYPE!
528;AM071AC;You sure?
1164;AA079DA;I don't want to walk here.
529;AM084BB;Agreed.
829;AG009BB;INCOMING!
2909;AE135_024;There are other fencers on site. Rendezvous with them.
559;AY059BE;Pardon me.
1792;AE183_028;FENCERS HAVE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE!
882;AE017Z;Assault
1615;AA052AC;Calm down. No danger.
2101;AE012V;Relax! I'll bring you back safe!
2341;AE145_038;Engage enemy robots. Destroy them.
3442;AA012DC;Although combat is tough, I really enjoy flying in the sky.
850;AY058DA;I'm sorry.
1284;AY065BE;I'll never do that again.
1214;AM138BA;That is also possible.
3066;AA090DA;Wow, the military equipment is truly advanced.
1726;AE200_007;THEY'RE FLYING MONSTERS!
680;AE125_028;Understood
1350;AM128DD;I'm really grateful.
7443;AU011BA;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie
7296;AE211_100;A super being that can create infinite energy. It's a creature superior to everything else.
2873;AA088BB;I didn't expect to really go on an underground adventure.
1870;AEX04_584;Shotgunners, we're counting on you.
734;AM048BE;Understood!
3357;AE126_017;There are too many monsters! Destroy the pylons! Quick!
620;AQ002CA;WOAH!
3349;AE121_002;It's larger than a building. How did they do that?
1414;AG003W;Incoming this way!
1560;AC016BD;And it's almost my turn.
867;AY049DD;Welcome
1378;AB001BE;AHHH!
2333;AO024BD;Watch closely at how I swap the magazine!
414;AM041ZA;Huh?
1092;AC005AC;Prepare to engage!
1712;AR009BB;Oh my gosh, Captain!
1318;AN011DD;We're joining your team.
989;AE011AC;STAY STRONG!
790;AM018ZA;I object.
7589;AU111CB;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
901;AM112BD;YOU'RE WRONG!
2739;AO024BC;Watch closely at how I swap the magazine!
4287;AE148_013;And they have deployed thousands of them. This might really be the end of the humankind.
2239;AE177_008;Come on, we Spriggans don't need cover.
1112;AE001_030;No need to be nervous.
820;AM123BB;That's not right!
1017;AA043BC;Do you think we'll win?
2191;AZ030G;105mm cannon, fire!
1821;AE045AB;Don't ever expect us to surrender!
1901;AL018BA;It was the last one remaining!
2055;AE180_018;You can stomp both left and right.
1462;AC004DC;Sensor is detecting enemies!
815;AY035BA;What a bummer.
4160;AE210_095;Calm down! Analyse the images and find a weak spot.
892;AH006BB;I'll back you up!
2906;AE125_014;This is Scout, enemy artillery unit confirmed!
1004;AM086DA;Did you take it wrong?
878;AE010DB;Keep the speed!
786;AG010AA;Been sighted!
1681;AL004ZA;E-D-F!
1931;AA070BA;What do you add to your sunny side up eggs?
1545;AA047DB;There is someone I'm interested in.
2854;AE117_049;We aren't done yet? What will happen next?
1121;AA034X;Why did you enlist?
1169;AO006Z;Cool down the spears!
3110;AE211_140;It's working. God is starting to slow down.
912;AP003DB;We got one!
1367;AN014BE;I'm counting on you, Captain!
1090;AM055BE;The answer is yes!
2654;AE176_049;This is Scout. Arcellus is coming out from underground.
2418;AT102AB;Can't move! Save me!
8208;AE107_024;We confirmed that the enemy already dropped monsters in this area before. Maybe they want to use this place as a monster colony. Please stay alert.
714;AM066BB;Forget it.
2031;AN004BA;It's my duty to protect civilians.
2261;AE112_059;Impressive. I will remember you.
1481;AD011BC;They're almost in range!
1013;AL015BA;All wiped out!
3055;AE117_041;Never expected you could make it this far. Impressive.
6802;AU162BB;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight. We trample our foes day and night.
1576;AE022W;I'LL LEAVE THE LEFT TO YOU!
1427;AE179_063;Something's behind the enemy!
1727;AA042AA;Your EDF is not afraid of the dark!
962;AM037CB;Let's go with it!
1070;AY061DA;I'll be more careful.
2046;AF010V;Don't jump the gun, wait for my order!
1548;AE005_006;Urgentness is unresponsive.
802;AE009BC;Gotcha!
2837;AD012AC;We'll miss the target at this range! Hold your fire!
880;AJ010Y;I said no!
1371;AEX04_707;Dispatching support vehicles.
1033;AM080BA;That's absolutely right.
2157;AL027DC;Is that all you got? Too weak.
588;AM042CA;That's it!
1036;AE027AA;SHUT IT DEAD!
3772;AA024BC;I've got some juicy steak. I'll cook some tomorrow.
1871;AE166_005;Engage enemies at this crossroad!
3998;AE114_031;Almost identical to humans. This is unbelievable.
1708;AA011BB;Let's get serious today!
3138;AEX04_234;The fog isn't as thick as before, and in that case...
2562;AE186_031;The nest is almost completely destroyed!
1970;AT204BE;Don't give up! I'm coming to save you!
903;AA080BA;You'll get lost!
1753;AE016Y;We're in battle! Come help us!
1444;AE195_015;Anchor has been destroyed!
2023;AI017BE;No! I can't fight anymore!
1092;AD002AB;Prepare to engage!
6887;AU172X;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
1016;AI010BA;I need help!
985;AO016BE;Where are my bullets?!
1512;AE025BE;THAT'S WHAT I'M WAITING FOR!
1001;AE006V;Attack
930;AM129DA;I have to thank you.
1699;AEX02_009;CAPTAIN!!!
1325;AL004AC;HA-HA!
3505;AE132_010;It seems the nest is going deeper. Let's make sure it's safe around here.
1219;AA064DC;Why did you choose to fly?
450;AY044DA;Hello?
4694;AE005_058;You saved me... Drago's
1389;AA005CA;Plasma Drive. Check.
3284;AA020BE;I've managed to survive this long, how can I die now?
1058;AL031DD;I'll take a rest.
612;AE004AC;FIRE!
1346;AC007BE;Let's start the fight soon!
1714;AA123BB;Let's scare the enemy to death!
4897;AE198_081;Barca team has taken heavy casualties. The situation is worse than we expected.
983;AM078AA;How can that be?
1921;AE152_001;Successfully closing in on the aliens.
1655;AD006BB;Attack them once they're in range!
690;AM009ZA;Awesome
3667;AE143_033;If we don't do something the city is done for, get moving!
691;AM207BE;Oh my!
1097;AE175_016;Queens down!
1941;AE018AA;We are the strongest! Fire!
966;AE031AB;SHOOT AT THE FRONT!
625;AB006ZA;HA!
6958;AU012AB;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
2397;AE146_043;Looks bad! They'll see us!
860;AY031DA;What a shame.
1544;AD015AC;CONFIRMED DISTANCE WITH THE ENEMY!
533;AEX04_006;Move it!
3643;AE109_023;Don't give up! Even if you get bitten, just shoot the monsters dead!
1024;AY061BE;I'll be more careful!
1477;AM125BA;You're absolutely wrong!
895;AE129_012;AN ALIEN!
5881;AZ026PA;That's me! I'm the one who built this satellite. I am the so-called god.
1818;AM009AA;Stop whining and start shooting!
1239;AE013BD;WATCH THIS!
1612;AM145DB;Is surely out of love.
1449;AM111DD;Can we change subjects?
1048;AP003Z;DESTROYED!
3017;AL001Z;AHHHHHHHH phone beeping
1583;AE166_010;Aliens! Two to go!
4373;AE178_006;Operation Stage 1 now begins. First of all, deal with those enemies on the ground.
1508;AF016DB;Is there any attack signal yet?
1317;AF008Z;Move in silent mode.
1971;AA106BA;I was still a security guard until last week.
1749;AE153_031;You made it! Thank you!
941;AM043X;I think so too.
1095;AM018BE;I'M IMPRESSED!
1644;AC004BC;Please leave it to me next time!
4688;AE111_026;It's only a matter of time till we run out of gas. We must find a way to break through.
2345;AA125BE;Poor enemy, they have to fight us.
723;AH005Y;Men down!
2619;AE112_034;I can't believe we're going under the transportation ships!
2453;AE167_012;We've confirmed something dropped down from the sky!
1677;AL049BD;Time to find the next enemy!
2323;AA044AA;We must annihilate all enemies underground!
1253;AK009BC;I heard there is the enemy!
1264;AE064BE;WHY, ISN'T IT DEAD YET?!
3778;AEX04_375;It's a mutated monster! It's got very high combat strength! Be careful!
3312;AE176_050;This is Scout! Arceolus is moving towards the combat area!
844;AP013BC;Defeated it!
1125;AE002_111;MONSTERS!
860;AP006DD;Direct hit!
2059;AE203_001;ENEMIES EVERYWHERE!
3243;AL038DC;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
954;AM109BE;Don't be stupid.
3010;AE141_028;There are still cannons on the sides and back. Destroy them!
4154;AE211_112;Storm One, humanity's fate lies on your shoulders!
813;AY066BC;My bad.
2858;AE140_009;Discovered units in battle! We'll go for rescue at once!
1710;AE127_021;THEY'RE COMING FROM BEHIND!
1538;AA021AB;Still remember the training, right?
2241;AE024X;Dare to eat me? Bring it on!
2562;AE203_006;We're surrounded by the enemy! We need backup!
1908;AEX04_334;Confirmed! Red color drone!
992;AL022BC;Hooray!
3284;AE110_032;The flying saucers have passed! Our operation failed!
1166;AC018BA;I'm counting on you, partner.
1633;AEX04_363;CONFIRMED! MOTHER MONSTER!
1757;AA099BE;If only I could make it back alive.
2077;AEX04_477;Aliens with powerful weapons
1559;AE005_040;All vehicles, spread out!
843;AN022BA;Nice meeting you.
347;AM030BE;Got it.
1161;AE131_063;Just too many!
1674;AO014BC;CRAP! I DON'T HAVE BULLETS!
1346;AE205_022;THE MONSTERS ARE HERE!
1257;AI013BE;The wound is hurting!
761;AE146_036;Thanks, dude!
1915;AA007V;We're invincible! Trust that!
1460;AY021BA;HAHAHAHAHAHA!
316;AM051BB;Ah!
1480;AI012DA;I won't be able to fight long!
824;AM099BD;Agreed.
2656;AD005DB;Confirm distance. Outside the range.
441;AM016Y;Roger!
1369;AY021BD;Ha ha ha ha!
3495;AA032V;We must believe that we will win! Believe that we will survive!
1718;AQ007CB;AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
1514;AU001V;Damn! I can't move!
612;AM066BD;Forget it.
818;AS006AA;Oh no!
1573;AD015AB;Confirm distance with the enemy!
1899;AE134_016;Those monsters can fly?
2478;AE197_009;Be careful, they will come down any second.
2639;AE146_046;Rescue team? Doesn't seem like it.
449;AE003ZA;Ahh!
1157;AA063BB;How about singing a song?
1323;AN013BD;Please take me with you!
7693;AU131AA;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1331;AC018BC;I'm counting on you, partner!
1311;AD007Z;CONFIRM THE DISTANCE!
646;AE003DA;UGH!
1306;AR017BC;It looks like one man died!
1467;AE176_026;AFVs, charge in!
1599;AL047BE;I still have some fight in me.
2738;AE109_025;We have each other's backs! Save me if I get caught!
974;AY020DA;Hahaha!
1303;AEX04_034;Two aliens left!
508;AE001DB;WAH!
3328;AEX04_377;Looks like a heavy armored teleportation ship! Stay on alert!
3707;AE159_041;You're too heavy to be a wing diver. Try to lose 20 kilos first.
427;AY025DC;Heh.
818;AM194BD;Because I like it.
1428;AEX04_040;Two more aliens out there!
940;AM215BE;WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
1504;AL011BA;E.D.F.!
1619;AD006DB;Asking for permission to attack!
2783;AY011DB;EDF doesn't leave its men behind. It's for real.
5639;AE145_066;RUN! RUN! AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
1051;AE054BC;Attacking now!
892;AR012DC;An ally fell!
1337;AM071DA;You're absolutely right!
2595;AQ007DB;WAAAAAAAAAH!
1860;AD001DA;The enemy is outside the range!
1507;AE200_008;It's flying types!
709;AF014DB;Shut up!
1973;AM146DD;Because I'm too poor to feed myself.
2020;AI018BC;It's hurting! I'm done!
701;AE007CA;Evade!
1213;AL035BA;It's harder than imagined.
1278;AT204DA;Someone got stuck!
2128;AE141_056;This is Swallow3, moving in!
1845;AZ023G;Civilian, get out of there and hide!
1457;AL038BA;I'd like to take a rest.
957;AM003ZA;Help the injured.
1570;AH024BB;Captain, please hold on!
1333;AL026BE;You did great too!
938;AE181_030;CoverBarga!
2505;AT206BC;Don't leave your men behind! Destroy the web!
860;AL021BA;Yahoo!
1046;AE112_038;Sir, yes, sir!
1095;AC009BD;I can't die!
1080;AP025BC;Took care of one!
1216;AQ010BB;The armor's broken!
2879;AN032BB;I'm so happy that I can fight together with a hero!
1323;AE003AB;HAAAAAARRRRRRR!
533;AQ003BD;Ugh!
1472;AE139_006;Yeah, blame those aliens!
1338;AE176_031;Scatter to the sides!
223;AB002DD;HEY!
3329;AE205_026;Hey Storm One, have you got a death wish too?
1192;AE161_012;They wanna run us over!
410;AY054BE;Good night.
1513;AG005BA;The enemy's coming this way!
1135;AM060Y;Are you sleep talking?
1029;AY018BA;Should be clear!
562;AM036DD;Yeah!
1259;AE052BB;Attack the body!
482;AM025DD;Okay!
1933;AK012BD;I got a bad feeling about this.
9922;AE159_044;It's the first time ever that humankind has witnessed a nest of the flying aggressors. Their fertility is probably superior to species alpha and beta.
1060;AF014BC;I'll warm up first.
21979;AE115_036;This is a special news flash. We've learned that the aliens that appeared in Europe look like humans. They walk on two feet, use weapons and tools with two hands, and can communicate in their language. Right now, many groups are planning to negotiate with the aliens. If a negotiation could take place, we might be able to resolve the conflict peacefully.
1788;AE005_018;Whether you're a Prof Liberal or a
1023;AM188BE;This is for love.
5178;AE176_067;The blazer's power is about 12% of EMC. The issue lies with the monster.
1418;AA136BC;Leave it to us fencers!
1518;AM177BB;Because all I know is fight.
1708;AN005W;We're counting on you, Storm One!
2148;AO024BE;Watch closely at how I swap the magazine!
3109;AE107_002;It's not just unsafe. This is worse than before.
2114;AR001Z;Is it too late? Damn it!
1089;AR021DC;We must revenge!
2517;AA045W;This place itself is more terrifying than the enemy.
876;AM107BA;That's not true.
2042;AEX04_576;Ranger 26, neutralize the enemy.
6526;AU142W;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
2301;AL003BB;E-D-F!
6854;AU012DC;Dear Russells, we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
1329;AO029BD;Change the cartridge!
1053;AC003DC;I will follow the plan.
1496;AY024BC;Heh heh heh heh...
1222;AE129_063;BACK OFF!
797;AA036BC;Do your best.
2122;AF023BE;When the captain fires, we fire together.
616;AM028AB;Approve!
1855;AE048BE;NOW, ATTACK ITS RIGHT SIDE!
931;AG006BC;We're spotted!
2126;AN025BB;So, you are my boss?
2749;AE113_014;Okay, let's go! Exterminate all monsters!
850;AM061BE;I can't do that!
1607;AEX04_195;Defend a support vehicle!
2279;AT108BD;I'm caught in the web! Rescue me!
1452;AEX03_015;Incoming aliens!
543;AZ025I;GO!
1434;AM008BB;Rescue is on the way!
2212;AF020BB;Don't get too close or you'll be exposed.
485;AQ005AA;AHHH
1389;AL022DC;I must save the energy.
1502;AO004BE;I'LL SWAP MY MAGAZINES!
898;AD011CA;Hold your fire!
1258;AEX04_212;I don't mind a little drizzle.
513;AM025Y;Roger!
908;AM063DC;Let's do this.
635;AY022BA;Hehe!
1336;AE186_002;We managed to close in!
1292;AEX04_369;CONFIRMED! SURVIVOR!
1273;AM024DC;You want me to praise you?
1671;AD005W;CONFIRMED DISTANCE WITH THE ENEMY!
807;AM112BB;You're wrong.
1477;AE198_022;Vargas 7, what's wrong?
2754;AE153_049;The operation was a success. Mission completed.
1004;AC004V;Prepare for battle!
1167;AL007DB;That's great!
427;AQ003EB;UGH
3922;AE164_023;We can't allow those drones to leave the area! Destroy them all!
2643;AE147_038;We have confirmed over 1,000.
6717;AU172W;Stand shoulder to shoulder now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
1709;AR040BE;Victim! There's a victim!
1241;AO007ZA;Cool down the system!
1752;AA082BC;I'm so nervous and I'm sweating.
2243;AZ004PB;System reboot, launch ready.
1856;AM032DA;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
1927;AE141_022;THERE'RE CANNONS EVERYWHERE!
496;AB006Z;MOVE
1078;AO011DC;Ready for cool down!
1450;AI012DC;I won't be able to fight long!
1461;AA077BE;Where does this cave lead to?
2467;AE164_029;The new type of drone is approaching!
1240;AE182_001;It got good confirmed!
1722;AC022BC;I'm okay. I'm not shaking.
1949;AE162_011;So that's the hooligan cannon?
2362;AA070BB;What do you add to your Sunnyside Up eggs?
563;AL012CA;Clear!
12413;AE202_075;I know, but I want to believe, I want to believe in something. The war is doomed, but if we can destroy the egg-shaped ships, humanity will stand a chance.
7559;AU121DC;Now pick up the weapons off we go Firing at the flying saucer shooting down our foe
1560;AL036BE;IT'S FINALLY OVER
3163;AE133_027;Nothing good can come out of this.
4777;AE133_038;They'll continue to breed if we leave any one of them alive. Make sure to eliminate them all.
772;AM036Z;You did it!
746;AM007CB;Amazing!
1305;AZ010H;Hurry! Get ready!
1277;AE034AA;I'LL LEAVE THE RIGHT TO YOU!
842;AP001V;THAT'S A HIT!
1164;AM109DD;Let's do it your way!
1389;AE037BA;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
5166;AE179_042;Now we have to risk our lives to recover it? Why do we get all the stupid missions?
955;AM036CB;That's right.
1623;AE180_028;Exterminate the monsters!
817;AM011AB;Just like that.
1276;AE020BA;FIRE YOUR WEAPON!
1612;AI009DA;An error in the flight system!
1270;AE178_033;That's impressive!
1448;AE105_013;SHOOT THEM DOWN!
3546;AE207_009;Let all bygones be bygones. See you in hell.
6799;AEX02_018;I can't fall asleep at night, and it sends a shiver down my spine whenever I think back. I really need some rest.
1883;AK003W;POSSIBLE ENEMY MOVEMENT DETECTED!
1145;AA036AA;We can only move on.
2136;AE128_040;The civilian evacuation is completed.
850;AM157DB;Do you mean it?
2309;AE139_009;So, this is what we're dealing with.
2385;AL008CA;AHHHHHH!!
1399;AE033BB;I'm invincible!
2899;AEX02_026;You will survive this and go home to your parents!
1819;AE020DD;Behold the dance of death!
1087;AM067X;Yeah, maybe!
2276;AD001X;I'll take good care of you when you're in range.
1719;AE016BC;Swallow this!
845;AM012BD;You're good!
1322;AS001FA;NOOOOOOO!
7805;AU151AC;Abandoned by my friends and family, Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
431;AJ017BC;Come here!
1152;AM048CA;Completely wrong!
1331;AJ008BA;Somebody help us!
1147;AM076DC;That's common sense!
2532;AE210_060;The enemy ship is preparing its cannons!
1096;AB004BC;FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN!
1572;AF019AA;Steady, the game's on soon.
1036;AM124BE;DON'T BE STUPID!
2495;AR003CA;I won't forget you! Leave the rest to me!
2354;AE013V;Keep shooting until all enemies down!
1637;AD004W;Shoot them once they're in range!
1126;AEX04_165;Defend this building!
4554;AS002W;AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!
1891;AA068DA;Why did you quit being a civilian pilot?
899;AN009BA;Let's fight together.
2014;AE114_006;That thing can fly?!
9870;AE131_015;If the monsters are reproducing here, it will be the worst situation for mankind. Make sure to reach the deepest part to uncover the truth.
951;AM107BD;That's not true!
1032;AEX04_174;Secure this square!
745;AD008BE;INCOMING!
528;AP001AC;We hit it!
1459;AEX04_702;Titans, engage the enemy!
1696;AE176_007;Let's start with nearby enemies!
1396;AN031DD;I'm all yours, hero!
1526;AE211_006;It's floating in the air!
3472;AE133_024;There might be more giant monsters. We have to kill them all.
3243;AZ003R;We can't provide artillery backup to operational areas now.
3216;AE005_002;Getting into the shooting range of EMC. Moving in.
1397;AJ007DB;Continue the operation!
3042;AE129_033;If the sandstorm is gone, we'll have no cover!
11586;AEX02_042;The government outlines new measures to tackle unemployment. Each new EDF recruit will receive 10,000 US dollars and an extra 20,000 more after 3 months of service.
1506;AC026BA;I'm the ultimate soldier!
1577;AM191BE;I did it out of spontaneity.
983;AK001BB;Confirm the enemy!
1101;AR019BB;One man down!
999;AY062DC;I shouldn't have done that.
1998;AK018BD;Today is such a tiring day.
1688;AA046DC;Have you been able to contact your family?
1061;AK007AB;Keep your guard up!
10126;AE105_025;We analyze their pattern of action. We think that these weapons are autonomous battle drones, and I am afraid their targets are humans.
2521;AEX04_569;This is Ranger 8. We've reached destination.
1111;AS005AA;Take down this one!
518;AP003BB;Hit!
4646;AE128_007;Are you a sniper too? We're the key to winning. So do your best.
891;AM049BD;Sir, yes sir!
1263;AY030DD;That was close!
1825;AF010BD;We should be able to take down the enemy now.
454;AY002BC;Thank you.
596;AM040CB;Correct!
2536;AZ010M;Why would a civilian know about Epimetheus?
1074;AEX04_001;Commence operation!
1727;AE149_029;Deroy severely damaged!
940;AP009DB;One down!
680;AY043DB;Good morning.
4406;AE131_019;They're certainly protecting the monsters! They plan to breed monsters!
2120;AM195BA;That's the answer I get after seeking what I want.
1254;AE117_047;We've killed them all!
785;AG007BC;We're found!
1414;AM137BE;No one is complaining.
897;AD010CA;Attack later!
4411;AE183_017;We have to defeat them. If they grow up, they will become a huge threat to humanity.
723;AY056DA;I'm outta here.
1848;AE005_054;That creature is a living powder keg!
858;AO008BE;I'm out of ammo!
1716;AE002_131;BEHIND THIS BLAST DOOR!
1122;AA083BE;We're not lost, are we?
1100;AL011AC;Enemies are wiped out!
1520;AS007AB;Figure something out!
5440;AE184_012;There are still many survivors in this area. Your priority is to exterminate the Aranaers.
2460;AM144DB;Because the sky is so blue and beautiful.
4288;AEX04_572;This is Ranger 2-1. We've reached target point. Commencing operation!
1920;AE141_068;Good. These attacks are effective.
789;AY020BD;Ha ha ha!
1111;AM080BE;That's absolutely right.
892;AB003AC;Let's go!
2213;AE004_021;Aliens are descending from the flying ship!
803;AL017AB;Well done, guys!
7463;AU011V;Oh, we are the valiant infantry, we are the alpha team with passion and camaraderie.
2508;AE105_060;This is Wingdiver. We have arrived on the scene.
1422;AE120_006;Use silent modules.
2774;AE004_022;So that is the enemy's landing ship.
1074;AA056AA;Don't get separated.
1565;AS003BD;Noooooo!
1977;AE104_045;The pylons are crashing down!
1918;AE105_035;This is Strategic Command Headquarters.
1102;AJ004BA;What should we do now?
3370;AE167_001;That teleportation anchor drop can cover a large area. Watch out!
584;AM034DB;Got it!
4014;AE146_045;This is Wingdiver. A teammate and I have survived. Request for support.
692;AM044Y;Yeah, sure!
4594;AA144BD;Although I am familiar with the use of private powered exoskeletons... Huh.
2002;AM197BB;It just somehow happened.
2722;AE002_145;You handled yourself pretty well back there, for a civilian.
1466;AE176_008;Eliminate all monsters!
2571;AE123_014;Two landing ships just entered the combat area!
2565;AA050DA;For a soldier, the most important thing is the brain.
1214;AL013ZA;System cool down.
1507;AE004_071;THEY LOOK DISGUSTING!
2196;AE161_016;Three teleportation ships are approaching.
868;AM043DB;No way!
1336;AH007BE;I WON'T LET YOU DIE!
2128;AM080Y;Too many reasons. I don't know where to start.
3674;AEX04_648;Grim Reaper have confirmed hostiles, eliminating targets.
1380;AE158_002;Are these light barriers?
1267;AE200_001;Charge!
1517;AU002X;I can't move!
631;AB011DC;Ugh.
1688;AM138BC;That is also possible.
1210;AE104_011;Is anywhere safe?
2110;AZ019J;Civilian you deserve my praise
3350;AE163_035;We need to collect new data. Engage the enemy now.
2821;AE105_059;At this rate, we will all die!
7701;AE143_061;It's unnatural for creatures that have developed such an advanced civilization to have no resistance to pollution. That means...
3120;AE144_021;We need data on the red monsters, fire at the red ones!
1571;AJ011BD;Where's the replacement, Commander?
1175;AH019BE;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
3833;AEX04_402;A red one! Don't get too close!
7208;AE147_032;We put up a good fight. However, it seems that was only a recon unit. The true power of the enemy is unpredictable.
3438;AE002_057;Never in my wildest dreams could I have thought I would be fighting monsters.
1436;AE118_035;Very well, attack now.
1302;AE047BD;I see our chance!
1523;AA037BA;Be serious sometimes!
1961;AF019AC;Steady, the game's on soon.
1630;AR011DB;One wind-diver is behind!
1378;AJ010BE;Should we really stay here?
1991;AE144_023;Look! A huge flying type!
1989;AF010DD;We'll be found if we get too close.
1812;AL033DD;Okay, let's call it a day.
2464;AE100_001;This way, watch out for incoming vehicles!
1419;AA097BD;I want to go home.
3329;AE107_022;The enemy seems to drop the monsters intensively in this area.
1514;AA011DB;My body feels heavy today.
1600;AZ018O;Bulge laser, stand by!
1478;AM142BE;Can I call you teacher?
16687;AE103_038;This is a special news flash. There have been multiple sightings of monsters in different areas. They can be highly dangerous, so please act with extreme caution in case you witness these monsters. Do not make an attempt to approach and report to the authority immediately.
1692;AL041BB;We can call it a day, can't we?
1261;AH008BD;YOU CAN'T DIE!
2746;AE121_018;Move in with our shields! Block the artillery fire!
2045;AE004_046;WHAT?! NO! BACK OFF!
2183;AA028BD;I want to eat barbecued meat now.
2105;AE129_019;I've never seen such a violent sandstorm!
2724;AE138_062;Radar has detected large-scale enemy movement.
7659;AU031V;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
2034;AE141_017;Don't think you'll harm a Titan like that!
809;AP009AB;Who's next?
1154;AE001BB;GRAH!
7710;AU151AB;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
2490;AEX04_109;Artillery unit deployed. Fire when ready.
2186;AN003AA;Don't mess around, civilian. Leave it to us.
2279;AE195_021;Ahhhhhhh!!!
1034;AEX04_177;HOLD THIS BUILDING!
1415;AL030DD;My work is done.
3356;AE176_022;AFV, approach the enemies. Infantry, cover from the rear.
1516;AC026BB;I'm the ultimate soldier.
1366;AA031AC;You get paid to do your job.
1552;AE161_001;PROTECT THE CIVILIANS!
1518;AE147_003;Sadly, nothing worked.
1953;AF011BD;Now's the time for a surprise attack!
1039;AO004Y;Reloading ammo
3053;AA088BD;I didn't expect to really go on an underground adventure.
1423;AE139_027;At least we had our run.
1800;AK006BB;The scout has spotted the enemy!
2003;AE190_019;SNIPER! ENEMY SNIPER!
2787;AZ001Q;This is Transport Chopper Hydra. We've brought a new vehicle.
878;AY014BB;I'm healed.
1519;AF001W;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
1439;AE118_038;This is Dover Leader, Roger.
754;AE009Y;Take this!
3539;AE116_025;They are carrying weapons! If you don't kill them, you'll be killed!
961;AE141_086;Five thousand?!
1400;AE131_047;We'll catch up with them soon!
3207;AA054BE;You didn't expect to do such a cool thing as protecting the Earth, did you?
2326;AD018DD;Plasma Drive, release power!
2663;AA010AC;EDF is the Guardian of Earth! We can't lose!
1648;AE112_032;Sergeant, good luck.
1021;AY072BC;We'll figure it out.
1865;AE004_082;AHHHHH!
2039;AE114_057;More aliens are landing on the ground!
1340;AC006DD;Sensor is responding!
5908;AE116_015;So they use monsters as their weapons, the cruelest and most brutal weapons imaginable!
1827;AI017BA;No, I can't fight anymore!
3763;AE186_025;This is Scout, attack was effective. The nest is starting to tilt.
644;AZ011K;Attack!
6826;AE001_009;I heard that you're a good mechanic, and you're also licensed to operate large vehicles. Am I right? That's very impressive.
2649;AA001ZA;Cowardice is shameful. Fly bravely.
1994;AE123_001;Alien landing ship confirmed!
1146;AEX04_118;Open fire!
1674;AA049AA;Use the radar, not your eyes.
1022;AL022BB;Hooray!
2527;AE188_005;Flying objects are passing through this area!
886;AC003Z;On your marks.
1537;AA003BC;My shooting skills are good!
2977;AE159_007;Team 3 is now heading to the mountaintop and exploring the area.
1241;AM077BA;THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN TROUBLE!
2059;AT004AA;It's pulling me in! Kill it!
636;AY045DA;Good evening.
1998;AA030BC;Following the orders can't be wrong.
1316;AO018BA;Reload, reload!
2373;AE133_023;What? We haven't reached the end yet?
780;AY042BD;Nice meeting you.
1312;AM005W;I'll figure something out!
1206;AS004DD;STOP IT!
1438;AN017AB;Looks like we have to fight together.
933;AM044DB;Impossible.
1235;AK017BD;This is hopeless.
1171;AE008BD;Go to hell!
1575;AG005Z;EXTERMINATE THE ENEMIES!
696;AM036BA;Sounds good.
2737;AE159_029;All teams, approach the nest from different directions.
1026;AM124BA;DON'T BE STUPID!
2348;AL050BB;It feels great to come back triumphantly.
1309;AZ020H;Fire the howitzer!
2813;AE124_013;This is Scout! A great number of enemies confirmed!
2342;AC007CA;Use your own judgment to change to flying combat.
1944;AE181_019;Use punch attacks against Arcelys.
6906;AA098DD;I plan to go back to being an airshow performer after my honorary discharge. I'm confident in doing an amazing show now!
499;AM052BC;Got it!
1821;AJ018BB;Over here! I'm over here!
3567;AA132BD;But with a trained body and a powered exoskeleton, it's not a problem.
21408;AE110_042;The visitors from outer space have been dubbed primers by EDF. Since we are at war, negotiation attempts have ended. The EDF has been criticized for its lack of effort in keeping the door to dialogue with the visitors open. It may not be the best policy to give up on peace talks at the initial stage. Shouldn't we continue to seek dialogue with the primers?
656;AL012DB;Clear!
881;AE033AC;More to the left!
628;AY059BA;Pardon me.
12295;AE178_041;Spriggans, you're Storm Four. Grim Reapers, you're Storm Three. Sergeant, you're Storm Two. And you, Storm One. This is the code name from now on, understood?
1307;AO005DA;Weapon power, Link!
1094;AC001AB;Everyone stay alert!
1749;AEX04_636;Fencer 3, engaging battle!
1736;AI002CA;System, condition four.
960;AL013CB;Neutralized!
1673;AA127BD;I can't imagine we'll lose.
3597;AA023AB;Leave tomorrow for tomorrow. Let's focus on how to win today first.
2361;AE186_021;Ground troop, take cover behind the tanks!
1305;AM005Z;I'll go down with you!
2365;AE192_002;The monsters have adapted to the Earth's environment!
8657;AE149_037;The Mothership continues to drop down Deroyes, causing devastating disasters. We can't stop the condition from getting worse.
2008;AT306DB;You are my hero! Thank you!
2079;AA041V;Use the radar and not your eyes!
637;AY024BA;Yeah.
1575;AM192BE;I simply wanted to do so.
942;AE194_017;Attack!
2043;AA016BA;I'm lucky, so I won't die here.
1061;AM046Y;You're absolutely right!
695;AY028BB;That's funny.
1649;AP010BC;We did it! Direct hit!
1525;AF005DB;Asking for permission to attack.
4266;AEX04_253;I've been to the monster's nest. This is nothing compared to that.
4094;AE174_025;We've confirmed different types of deroy, short-legged and long-legged.
438;AQ003CB;AHHH!
1201;AM107DD;That would be nice.
2154;AEX04_429;The monster's bodies are covered in armor!
1129;AD005ZA;Prepare to shoot!
1046;AE180_032;Aliens incoming!
728;AL016BB;We won!
4290;AE179_024;I know you love the underground, but sorry, this is our base.
1231;AA007CA;There seems to be no wind.
1766;AF007BE;Enemy in sight, let's attack!
2113;AE105_068;Arms 1. Initiate combat.
2969;AA014W;Soldiers have to be strong, no matter what.
1468;AD004Z;Remove spear locks.
1958;AC015AC;Just a tiny mistake, you die.
7664;AU141CA;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
1565;AL029BE;I killed the last one!
481;AM209BC;AHHH!
849;AM208BA;Whoa!
1233;AE117_033;Assault team spotted!
1233;AP005Y;YEAH WE BEAT IT!
1617;AC017BB;Don't die! Stay alive!
6598;AE140_036;We're very interested in those who made a vital contribution to the victory. They will be our role models from now on.
1301;AE036AC;I'll leave the front to you!
1138;AG006W;Looks like we're found!
3302;AA029V;Those aliens should know that coming to this planet is a mistake!
1866;AA034AA;A brighter future is waiting for us.
891;AM002AA;STAY CALM!
1003;AEX04_027;Enemy from the rear!
2378;AA061BA;It's too dangerous. Do you still wanna fight?
1819;AA062BC;Wanna play a word chain game?
516;AM170BC;Thank you!
1439;AA048BC;No one can beat me in poker!
2065;AE162_008;Fire at the teleportation ships!
755;AM030V;That's true.
2598;AA087DD;I might go crazy before I beat the enemy.
732;AM015DA;Well done!
1114;AN007DC;I'll follow your command.
1051;AA009AA;We won't lose!

938;AY006DC;I owe you one.
2660;AE140_029;I'll take care of the little brats, you go for the big ones!
1463;AE001_031;I'm opening the gate now.
661;AL020BC;We did it!
2122;AA102DC;We should never lose to fencers!
2283;AE159_014;Team 3 speaking. Flying type confirmed.
773;AM169BD;Thank you, sir.
2843;AA052DB;Don't judge me by my looks. I have a degree.
3626;AE112_006;After five months of war, the situation has only gotten worse.
935;AY046BD;Let's fight together!
512;AM042ZA;WHAT?!
3526;AE193_010;That teleportation device is too dangerous. It has to be destroyed.
967;AN013BA;Please take me with you!
845;AG007BA;We're found!
3268;AE150_003;I know it's a night raid, but who says they sleep at night?
2116;AE191_020;Up here! Climb all the way up!
1514;AE129_038;IT'S THE ENEMY LANDING SHIP!
1612;AE176_061;That was impressive!
1713;AN021DD;I'll be on your side all the time!
651;AA001AC;Keep watch.
2767;AZ017L;Withvermethius, mankind will never lose!
2477;AE144_012;I should have spent more time at the shooting range!
1593;AM005AB;We're soldiers! Hang in there!
1507;AE029BD;Don't play dumb! Shoot!
995;AR013BB;ONE MAN DIED!
12729;AEX02_044;The government outlines stronger relief measures to tackle unemployment. Each new EDF recruit will receive 50,000 US dollars and an extra 500,000 more after one year of service.
773;AK014BE;NEW ENEMY!
809;AS001EA;Whoa!
1373;AB003W;Follow behind the sergeant!
2189;AA060BD;This is not a game, ya got that?
2191;AF015BD;I must move in carefully without being spotted.
833;AS004BB;Stop that!
1786;AA001EE;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2784;AE111_027;The Air Force is preparing a new type of aircraft now.
570;AM024AC;Approved.
1692;AE013CB;Capture them in the sky!
2664;AA085BD;I hate dark and narrow places.
1802;AD016BD;Enter the range! Come on!
1751;AE022DA;I'm the queen of the sky!
2699;AE131_013;Are they trying to build their nest underground?
2280;AA015ZA;Don't depend too much on stabilizers.
1172;AF025BD;Can we attack now?
3291;AE205_029;We discovered a new mothership. It's approaching this area.
3551;AE134_008;Use close range weapons! We'll take care of the teleportation ships!
1060;AE146_047;How did you get here?
1628;AE180_013;We will help control this thing.
1002;AY076BC;We're partners, right?
1147;AO005BB;Reloading ammo.
3667;AE199_031;If we don't eradicate them all, we'll lose the whole city!
5333;AE110_027;If our attacks don't work, we can't put up a fight. If we can't retaliate, we're just sitting ducks.
2050;AF008AA;Get prepared before the enemy sees us.
3010;AE198_066;Mysterious monster Arcle is spotted! Multiple!
1668;AE199_013;THE MONSTERS ARE HERE!
695;AY014BC;I'm healed.

3144;AQ014BA;ARGHHHHH!
1265;AM078W;I don't want to talk about it.
4132;AE145_067;We suspect that the aliens are not wearing armors, but space suits.
943;AC012AB;Check on both sides.
1943;AT110BC;Somebody destroy the web!
868;AR003X;Man down!
1839;AZ016L;Aliens can't invade into the sea!
693;AF001CA;Go carefully.
1829;AA053BE;Have you ever wondered why this would happen?
4932;AE176_066;The blazer has the same power level as EMC, the issue lies with the monster.
4121;AE110_046;Does this technology teleport objects? That's amazing.
1382;AE114_015;AFEs move in
1931;AN010CB;Well then, I'll protect you.
594;AR005AC;You alright?
1884;AJ011BA;Where is the replacement commander?!
1607;AG004BB;The enemy is closing in!
688;AM037Y;Impossible!

1478;AM092DD;Better keep it to yourself!
2720;AI003BE;It's no good if the situation goes on like this!
931;AM171BE;I'm grateful!
3591;AA120BC;Being a soldier isn't a special job anymore nowadays.
688;AO003Z;Charge!

2471;AE149_011;Attack the legs! Destroy those cannons!
1265;AA032AA;Let's reverse the tide.
2074;AE138_018;Damn! Why aren't the railguns here yet?

1494;AE210_142;Put that thing under arrest!
614;AG010AB;Have you been sighted?
508;AY043BD;Good morning.
3496;AE123_020;A large number of landing ships are heading towards the combat area!
1136;AM122BD;That's not true!
5225;AE001_006;So that's the aerial unit. I wish I could fly too. Looking forward to your show.
1198;AK001X;ENEMY!
954;AF003CA;Not spotted yet.
2262;AT305AC;I'm still alive. It's all thanks to you.
1323;AR018BC;An ally got chewed up!

2894;AE166_003;They can regenerate after some time! Go for the kill!
2526;AE002_075;Those creatures ate their way through the ceilings to get in!
1494;AE004_051;ENEMY ON THE LEFT, TOO!
1445;AEX04_237;A S A D S T O R M
2343;AE210_028;Looks like the giant cannon has been damaged!
1737;AJ002BC;The situation is terrible!
2543;AF006V;Proceed carefully, don't get caught by the enemy.
660;AO003Y;Reloading
2021;AR009BD;Oh my gosh! Captain!
1466;AL005W;WE DID IT!
1621;AI002ZA;I WILL TAKE REVENGE!
756;AE104_043;THEY'RE BACK!
2964;AE207_011;I'm sorry. There's no one left to save them.
1672;AM008DD;Get up and keep fighting!
782;AM035BA;Sir, yes sir!
1314;AF005CA;The enemy can't catch us.
4257;AE159_002;Investigate nearby areas. Annihilate the flying type once you spot them.
1203;AE163_041;Backup is on its way.
7616;AU141BB;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
1008;AB014BD;What's the rush?
1571;AM143BE;Can we change the subject?
774;AR002BB;Captain!
1788;AE140_019;Damn, it's starting to rain.
2530;AO007AA;Reloading! Back me up for two seconds!
3502;AE205_027;This is Storm Two, heading out to rescue Storm Four.
1608;AD007BC;CONFIRM THE SHOOTING RANGE!
3990;AZ004G;This is DE-202. We're flying to cover the ground units again.
1856;AE210_019;Teleportation ship destroyed!
2153;AF017BE;Lower your voice, or they will find us.
1490;AT201AC;Save those tangled by the web!
1767;AEX04_681;Cougar 3, smooth sailing.
867;AY003BC;Let me thank you.
883;AE130_020;Fire!
2328;AE108_003;Pylons are being dropped. Stay alert.
1997;AE181_004;There's a problem. The pilot is missing.
867;AM186BA;This is for a living.
949;AM022BC;It's genius!
875;AN012BE;I'll fight with you!
1578;AE168_012;The fog gets thicker!
1777;AM143DB;Because I love the sky.
505;AM062CB;WHAT?!
1971;AE160_015;The enemy's landing ship is ascending.
3050;AE137_026;Such a small strike team should be a surprise to the aliens.
1505;AE108_006;THEY'RE CRASHING DOWN!
2887;AE172_007;Their defense is extremely strong! Be careful!
2050;AA047BA;I can make the best dishes in the world.
3731;AA032BB;If I had known this would happen, I would have done my training seriously.
885;AE039BA;SWEET!
600;AM018V;Alright.
2011;AE179_013;What missing? Where did he go?
4649;AEX04_202;You soldiers have only one goal. That is to fight and to survive. Got it?
1119;AL032DA;Time for a rest.
329;AY054BC;Good night.
2371;AA016BD;I'm lucky, so I won't die here.
716;AM050BD;Sounds good.
1524;AL014V;Prepare for next battle!
1496;AE109_019;HERE THEY COME AGAIN!
995;AM020DC;We can't lose!
1085;AA016AA;Focus on the mission.
2162;AE145_011;Use the overpass to confront the enemy!
815;AP006ZA;Good kill!
1860;AZ027PB;You have good taste, Aerator.
1341;AE113_010;Newbie, stay close!
1268;AM070X;ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
2141;AL043BB;Can I be discharged after this mission?
2496;AE134_018;I can't believe this!
1344;AA065BA;Why'd you join the EDF?
890;AD009DB;Ready to shoot!
1470;AM026BC;How long have you been practicing?
602;AE179_012;Round up!
1305;AT104AA;I can't move at all!
1499;AZ012PA;Target locked on.
1931;AI019BB;Damn! It's burning!
2184;AT110BD;Somebody destroy the web!
1774;AEX04_335;Confirmed, type two drone.
1868;AA016BE;I'm lucky, so I won't die here.
2542;AE141_113;I heard they defeated thousands of aliens!
2188;AEX04_621;This is Wing Diver 2. We've arrived.
2915;AE170_031;That railgun is in perfect condition. Do you know how to use it?
966;AEX04_136;Open fire!
7664;AU141DA;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
1198;AEX04_064;Shot down confirmed.
1689;AE004_010;EXTERMINATE THE MONSTERS!
1284;AT301BD;Thanks for saving me!
2708;AA013BC;They must be surprised with Earthling's recklessness.
1446;AA039W;Why'd you join the EDF?
1773;AE204_009;Take out the large ones!
4506;AA017Z;If you're going to die, die here. Die for your brothers.
714;AG012BC;Come here!
1973;AE186_030;The nest seems to be damaged!
730;AM149DA;Because I'm pretty.
2862;AA128BD;How can we lose with such powerful heavy armaments?
2455;AT002V;Set me free! Set me free!
1532;AF024BA;Still no signal to attack?
4001;AE201_016;The aliens have taken over the sky! What happened to our Air Force?!
452;AQ001AA;Ugh!
1409;AO003V;Swap new magazines!
1255;AJ005DB;WHERE'S THE REINFORCEMENT?!
827;AM004DC;I'll back you up!
3010;AE129_007;I'm starting to think that the sandstorm is awesome!
1271;AE047BB;I see our chance!
14553;AE109_031;This is an emergency news flash. EDF just made a major announcement. Spaceships were discovered and presumed to be owned by extraterrestrials. The spaceships have arrived on the Earth's orbit and the EDF has started battling with aliens in some regions.
5714;AE104_033;It's flying above the combat area now. It may deploy pylons. Please be on high alert to the sky.
575;AM087W;WHAT?!
1916;AJ018BE;Over here! I'm over here!
1498;AE129_035;The aliens are closing in!
1545;AE022DC;I'M THE QUEEN OF THE SKY!
567;AM210BE;Whoa!
7072;AE199_037;According to their plan the environment won't be harmed. It's just us humans who will be eradicated
2769;AE002_076;Looks like there's no functioning powered exoskeleton left.
4358;AA018DC;I'm grateful that I've been able to fly in the sky every day since I became a soldier.
1356;AE177_001;Are we there yet?
1031;AJ006Y;Ask for backup!
1754;AA028AA;Stay alive no matter what.
860;AE022AA;HEADSHOT!
1765;AD002DB;BEYOND WEAPON EFFECTIVE RANGE!
1016;AA111BD;Do you like the army?
2652;AE133_036;Destroy the nest and stop these monsters from breeding!
2233;AE058BD;Huh? AAAA-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aa-A-A-A-A!
1253;AR021BE;Someone got killed!
888;AN016DD;All yours!
1602;AS004EE;LET GO!!!
1652;AL018BD;It was the last one remaining!
6919;AU152AC;Why should I still keep on fighting on? Shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn.
4452;AA020ZA;You have more flying experience than anyone else. Show them the results.
2242;AE211_002;What's with that giant?
817;AF016AC;Don't wake them up.
535;AS002EA;UGH!
2432;AK013DD;You've detected a reaction? What's this?
1597;AP004AA;Saw that? Direct hit!
491;AM029DC;Roger.
1334;AL007BE;Hooray!
1323;AH003ZA;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
795;AY073DA;It's nothing.
839;AE194_018;Scatter them!
859;AS002BA;AHHH!
1971;AE069BE;Don't underestimate humans!
2073;AF008BE;Captain, request permission to fire.
3800;AA027Z;Let's eliminate those enemies hiding in the dark. Follow me.
1549;AO004V;I'LL SWAP MY MAGAZINES!
2319;AT001ZA;I can't fly! Cut the thread for me!
1490;AO003CB;Plasma power, charge!
1298;AL025BA;It was the last one, right?
1478;AE002_022;Attack the monsters!
805;AM057AC;That's not true!
1527;AA025DC;Aerial unit checked.
1704;AN030BD;Wow, it's you!
1212;AD012DB;That's not good enough!
1028;AC022DC;Now is the time!
1832;AE210_053;It's not looking good for us either!
2550;AE144_045;Bad news! A mothership is drawing close!
1165;AY035BD;What a bummer.
2695;AA033AB;If this operation succeeds, we can change the result.
1633;AR007BD;I WILL AVENGE HER CAPTAIN!
1581;AE107_047;Hey, what are those?
1287;AA035DA;Let's do this together.
3703;AE131_059;I have a bad feeling about this. Wonder what we're up against this time.
1669;AE200_009;Keep going! Rush forward!
908;AE010DA;Keep the speed!
1465;AP009BB;We hit it, next!
986;AC019BB;Can't stop shaking?
3229;AE159_065;We're no match for them with our current strength! All units, retreat!
1041;AE004BC;Fire!
2349;AL001DC;AAAAAAAAAA
2044;AT301DB;Thank you for coming to help!
879;AM047DB;I refuse.
2431;AT206BD;Don't leave your men behind! Destroy the web!
1339;AA032Y;I must fight for my friends!
1489;AE113_042;There are TEN of those?!
957;AD003X;There's the enemy.
2472;AE011Y;I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
1045;AE129_018;Take down the drones!
2382;AEX04_528;It's a monster teleportation device!
707;AY022BE;Heh heh!
397;AQ001DB;Ah!
10182;AE155_031;These monsters will be called Aranea from now on. We have confirmed they use threads to capture and glue their prey onto their web. Please be extra careful.
1604;AE146_051;I thought this would be the end of me.
1030;AM164BE;I appreciate it.
686;AM072DD;That's right!
1007;AM151DA;Money is important.
1645;AE145_012;We must secure the high ground!
1001;AM062X;I'm okay with that.
750;AP011DC;We did it!
1431;AZ014PA;Output increased.
1559;AA019BA;I can't possibly die.
3536;AE150_040;Fire at the mysterious monster! Don't let it walk away unscathed!
1850;AT004AC;It's pulling me in! Kill it!
1021;AK006V;Ready for battle!
831;AM056DC;That won't work.
1388;AM145DA;It's surely out of love.
720;AM166DC;WHAT HAPPENED?!
2680;AA071DA;Wingdivers are not suited for underground battles!
3100;AE113_030;You're amazing! Do you want to join our team officially?
600;AE002_127;THIS WAY!
1770;AD022DD;Confirm distance with the enemy!
3957;AEX04_315;From now on, the aliens in spacesuits will be called cosmonauts.
1824;AE158_023;Go after them! Destroy them!
3258;AE107_041;This is the best job ever, as long as there are no monsters.
2092;AI006DD;Is the shock absorber overloading?
1186;AF019DB;They haven't found us yet.
1376;AO005CA;Weapon Power, Link!
3223;AE210_103;THIS IS WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL NEWS!
2405;AE202_008;THEY'RE TOO FAST TO USE EXPLOSIVES!
6932;AE141_103;Come from Beijing! Operation Crossroad succeeded! Enemy forces, disintegrated! Our damage, minor.
1362;AM107BC;That's not true.
1007;AE109_029;This is absurd.
2068;AE139_007;Yeah, shame on them.
852;AP005BC;Bullseye!
4041;AE114_004;AFVs, move out. Infantry, move with the AFVs.
2076;AD014DB;I'll shoot you dead once you step into range!
557;AO002DA;Reload!
848;AM042Z;What the...
881;AE001_041;Are you alright?
1461;AE127_027;THEY'RE COMING FROM THE SIDE!
1609;AEX04_283;CONFIRMED, COSMONAUGHT!
2310;AEX03_011;Such terrible monsters!
985;AC016BB;It's almost my turn.
1069;AO031BE;Swap the cartridge!
2670;AA033W;I'm a hero who protects the Earth. I'm proud of that.
1091;AE100_016;You got talent!
2493;AZ004Q;This is Transport Chopper. Vehicle is on the go.
2396;AE128_055;Damn! The line of defense is useless!
1325;AL004BA;WOO-HOO!
1697;AD018BD;Take them down when they get closer!
1157;AM075BE;Easy for you to say!
1404;AM191BB;I did it out of spontaneity.
516;AEX04_145;Delete!
570;AY053DA;See you.
1816;AA122BD;I can't wait to start the fight!
3209;AA104BA;I used to be a security guard. Somehow I became a soldier.
2026;AE004_007;MORE FLYING SAUCERS THAN EXPECTED!
921;AP003DA;We got one!
962;AM066DA;That's what I was taught.
1413;AO015BB;Where's my magazine?!
1394;AC011BB;I will survive.
785;AY070DB;Fine by me.
583;AE005CA;Attack!
411;AY024BB;Heh.
929;AE032AB;More to the right!
1661;AA034CB;Don't fool around when flying!
3344;AT103AB;Yo, this is bad. At this rate...
2561;AE199_029;Watch out! That building is coming down!
1003;AE176_030;Enemies to the left!
483;AN010BB;Goodbye.
1633;AEX04_181;Engage enemy from this position!
480;AM013ZA;All right.
2540;AV002V;Destroy the net! Save our guys!
1281;AE153_003;It's chaos right now!
2040;AM175BC;Because I'm the ally of justice.
2335;AR006W;A friendly gunshot! Call the medic!
570;AE211_023;Did it work?
1662;AD012BE;Show it to them once they're in range!
1921;AE195_011;A TRIGANTIC SPECIES BETA!
896;AM007BB;Don't give up!
988;AM043ZA;Oh my gosh!
346;AM069AC;WHAT?!
974;AN017DA;Nice meeting you.
2558;AT001V;I'M CALLING THE WEB! SAVE ME!
1110;AA035BE;Get fired up!
1184;AL016Y;That was a tough fight!
1773;AA010BC;I am not trained for this.
3745;AZ022PA;This gun of light can eradicate everything, including gods.
2617;AE156_006;I can't move! Help!
919;AC005BA;Enemy spotted!
2038;AE210_111;What a horrible life we had.
1184;AF004W;The enemy didn't see us.
1454;AY057BE;When this is over, I'm out.
2218;AF022BA;Don't do anything before the captain fires!
4406;AE207_013;Number 11 is gathering all nearby forces. It wants to destroy this area!
3475;AE127_009;Just finish the monsters before they approach. There is no need to fear.
773;AH003DD;Hold on!
6128;AE137_027;As long as that mobile base is active, the aliens will have total control over the ground. We must destroy it.
1172;AZ011I;It's a smoke grenade!
938;AM020X;Sir, yes sir!
943;AM097BE;That is correct!
2056;AE172_013;We've confirmed! Shields are down!
3149;AEX04_245;On a huge sandstorm. Be careful of your surroundings.
2662;AE114_061;THE ENEMIES ARE HIDING IN THE SHADOWS OF BUILDINGS!
1043;AA040DD;How's it going?
2396;AE112_026;The enemies are almost at the gate now!
3608;AE169_005;Enormous! Like ten times bigger!
4497;AE106_021;This is Rabbit Team. We'll fight to the end. Charge!
1010;AG013BE;OH NO!
1608;AN007V;You lead, I'll cover you.
2205;AW002ZA;You saved me! Thank you so much!
1016;AN017DD;Nice meeting you!
1310;AM136DD;Thank you so much!
1796;AEX04_021;Enemy coming from both sides!
589;AR008DD;BOSS!
1905;AT309DB;You came! Thank you!
268;AM068AB;WOAH
2783;AS002CA;Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
2709;AA087BD;I don't want to fight those things in a place like this!
2969;AA041X;I had always wanted to have a secret base like this when I was a kid.
1561;AA009CA;What a beautiful sky.
2345;AE116_007;The aliens and monsters are in it together!
574;AM043BC;GOT IT!
3312;AEX04_242;What a sandstorm! The electronic equipment is malfunctioning!
1946;AE176_024;AFVs have arrived for backup.
725;AM078DC;I got that!
616;AM052AA;WRONG
1137;AN020DD;All yours, Captain!
4751;AE128_033;If they break through this area, the defense line will break down. You must hold them off at all cost.
1631;AN018AC;Never thought I'd be under your command.
2583;AEX04_478;Aliens! With a new type of weapon!
385;AM011W;Got it!
934;AY060BE;I apologize.
448;AM052AC;WRONG
808;AM121DA;I'm bored.
449;AB005AB;RUN!
3535;AE210_074;Please, hold your thoughts! Our men are getting massacred!
1508;AM056W;You've got the wrong idea!
1651;AE029BE;DON'T PLAY DUMB! SHOOT!
2505;AA052DA;Don't judge me by my looks. I have a degree.
2963;AE131_034;So, half of the cave was formed naturally.
370;AM052BE;Got it!
1379;AE210_138;How is that possible?
1332;AP009BA;We hit it! Next!
1060;AEX04_364;Confirmed! King!
1225;AY033BB;I'm disappointed.
2588;AA005Z;Don't die in vain, die for your brothers!
2101;AC005DB;Enemies detected. Really close.
1655;AK003DA;Let's check the enemy from above!
1787;AE115_013;We have to work together, okay?
2438;AE042BC;Did you see that? I'm unmatched!
3093;AE129_006;Now we can complete our mission without taking gunfire from the base!
1287;AE190_029;Starting Air Raid!
1788;AE190_005;Infantry! We will cover you!
999;AE146_042;I'll give you a hand.
1985;AE001_049;Now I'm going to teach you how to use it.
3695;AE210_101;Someone is still fighting! SOMEONE IS STILL FIGHTING!
2752;AE190_024;Requesting artillery fire on enemy sniper!
1095;AJ003BD;TRAP!
2314;AN006BA;You're only a civilian, but you are brave.
1277;AM129DD;I have to thank you!
2058;AF019BD;Once you fire, they will see us.
1208;AG001BD;Looks like we're found!
1246;AE103_048;They will crash down here!
1195;AM023DB;I'll reward you later!
2493;AF015DD;Do not fire before the captain gives the order!
2334;AE160_010;The enemy didn't notice us. Keep moving.
1942;AN001BE;Are you a civilian? I'll protect you.
1143;AD002BA;The enemy is closing in!
1633;AE168_006;Yeah, it's so heavy!
895;AM035BD;Sir, yes sir!
3687;AR004DB;Oh no! The Captain is... Contact the headquarters!
5731;AE141_109;I repeat, 70% of aliens were eliminated. We suffered minor casualties.
1437;AM192BB;I simply wanted to do so.
1359;AM152BD;Okay, okay!
772;AP015BE;We got one!
1675;AN023AC;I'm surprised to meet our ace here.
1418;AL005BA;YEAH!
2470;AE173_017;We have confirmed a giant flying object!
2145;AE174_011;Next five, Master Arm on.
2212;AZ053G;Well, did the enemy get blown away?
4015;AE147_006;We have to fight the enemies under the mothership? That doesn't sound right.
805;AM014AA;AMAZING!
2355;AEX04_223;Use the snow as cover and keep moving!
1531;AE160_006;We should at least send more people.
1536;AE129_040;LOOK! MONSTERS!
744;AA037Y;Why are you here?
3313;AE119_037;This is a great vantage point! Shoot! Take out all monsters!
1078;AE180_023;Go for support!
3153;AE116_026;There are more? This isn't what I signed up for!
1533;AR028BB;Big bro got chewed up!
763;AQ013BE;I've been hit!
2057;AE062BC;I don't want to die! Not now!
1277;AM124BD;DON'T BE STUPID!
2187;AE178_011;Attack! Teleportation anchors!
1790;AN008DD;Wingdivers, at your command!
1246;AM021BA;We can't lose!
875;AM125DD;Thank you!
336;AP003AC;Hit!
1662;AE143_029;Eyes up! Don't get hit!
4474;AE002_148;Please come in. Requesting surface sit-rep. Damn.
1080;AE100_025;Pull it together!
2277;AA009BE;It's just pulling the trigger. Piece of cake.
2906;AZ007I;I'll prove to everyone the tactical edge the artillery can give.
2686;AE195_007;I wonder what happened to the Vanguard.
2789;AE103_049;There's too many of them. This base won't make it.
1263;AY074DD;You're good enough!
2602;AZ030J;Bombing complete. Preparation for next attack.
2240;AY011BE;EDF doesn't leave men behind. Ever.
417;AQ001EB;OH!
1778;AI004BA;I can still fight!
868;AM064AA;I'll pay you back.
1159;AD008DD;Entering the range!
769;AM053BC;Leave it to me!
888;AM149DC;Because I'm pretty.
1531;AA028DD;Aurora Steer, cut.
663;AM050BC;SOUNDS GOOD!
1193;AN014BA;I'm counting on you, Captain.
1633;AF017DB;We could be spotted once we attack.
666;AM079Y;I can't tell.
1534;AE005_026;It's coming towards us!
903;AM012BB;You're good!
4785;AE104_019;I promise I will take you to a safe place this time after we deal with the pylons.
545;AY066BA;My bad.
1556;AS014BB;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1732;AE002_008;And your hands can't be shaking.
5182;AE001_044;This is an emergency. Our current location, the base underground, is being invaded by monsters.
1154;AR024BC;Farewell, comrade.
1440;AE211_058;I don't believe it.
4606;AE202_003;I'm gonna die! Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
1672;AL034BE;I hope this is the final part!
1845;AE155_015;My legs feel like jelly!
2526;AE141_055;This is Swallow 3, striking the base!
1053;AY056BD;I'm outta here.
1197;AJ006DA;Report the casualties!
460;AM061AA;Thank you.
1255;AE110_023;Fire!
2181;AN001BA;Are you a civilian? I'll protect you.
1561;AR005Y;Man down! Unresponsive!
3082;AE183_020;There's too many! We can't deal with them alone!
1472;AK005AC;It's the enemy's reinforcement!
1206;AC014AA;The enemy is nearby!
1068;AY064BC;I didn't mean to!
906;AQ003FD;AHHH!
589;AA038BE;Cover me.
1982;AD013DD;Still outside the effective range.
723;AE133_007;Monsters
1180;AD008CB;Switch to attack mode!
972;AP012BB;It's finished!
385;AM046AC;Fine.
1963;AA032DA;Diagnostic system activated.
1504;AK009DC;There seems to be something nearby.
1224;AI008AB;There are cracks in my armor!
2017;AR013DC;Report, one diver fell.
2037;AG005W;The enemy is drawing close fast!
913;AM061BC;I can't do that.
1174;AQ011BB;The armor's damaged!
5101;AE162_027;It'll be the greatest victory in history if we eliminate Arcalus. You'll get more than a Medal of Honor!
921;AY038DD;Greetings!
3698;AE147_033;Even so, we'll keep on fighting. Just do your best.
2122;AF027BE;Are we launching the surprise attack or not?
733;AZ027G;Take this!
2017;AN025DC;Wingdivers will secure your safety.
1365;AA003FD;AAAAAAAH!
2350;AA090BB;I wanna go back before I freak out.
1940;AS015BA;Somebody kill this guy!
630;AM047AC;Let's go with it.
1266;AM081Y;Because I love my family.
2662;AZ034I;What, a civilian? Thank you for your help!
1768;AEX04_274;Confirmed, Aranea.
1628;AM040DC;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
3273;AA103BC;I want to be a hero, but it looks like I can't be one.
3843;AE171_006;Other troops will arrive later. We might need to do their jobs.
2109;AL005Z;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
1013;AE210_109;We're moving in!
692;AE130_013;FOLLOW US!
1179;AY061DD;I'll be more careful.
548;AY049DA;Welcome.
2332;AI002AC;If I go down, they're under your command.
4313;AE166_004;This is Blood One, proceeding to fight! Infantry unit, give way!
2266;AEX04_382;The enemy is dangerous! Stay alert!
2113;AC021BC;Stay calm, I have to stay calm!
556;AA015AB;Don't let up.
6689;AU142AA;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
3252;AEX01_009;They are elite wing divers! They are not to be messed with!
1357;AA010DC;My body feels light today.
1795;AR038BB;My- My buddy's dead!
549;AM036DB;Yeah!
4265;AE140_040;If that name evokes hope, then that's what we desperately need.
2891;AT311DD;It turns out all I heard is true. Thank you.
1915;AE187_003;HOW DARE THEY DESTROY OUR CITY!
3413;AE109_010;This place isn't safe! It's more dangerous than before!
1427;AE166_014;The landing ships are coming!
510;AH002BC;Dodge!
3570;AE135_025;These enemies are very dangerous. Don't let your guard down.
1893;AM005AA;Or soldiers, hang in there!
1225;AC008CA;Unlock weapon system!
1055;AB009DA;YEAH!
1945;AE004_052;WAAAAAAAAAAA
2845;AZ019G;DE-202, target confirmed.
1668;AN001Y;Civilian! You alright?
2274;AE114_007;Their technology is on a completely different level.
604;AM099BE;Agreed!
1235;AE133_001;Is this the end of the cave?
600;AB006BD;GO!
516;AQ005BB;NERD!
2307;AT207BB;Help your allies! Destroy the web!
1101;AM084DC;You're not helping at all!
670;AM133DB;Thank you!
1332;AA064AA;FENCES ARE INVINCIBLE!
1989;AE064BB;WHY ISN'T IT DEAD YET?!
2185;AL011CB;E-D-F!
1477;AE185_010;The bridge collapsed!
518;AY051BA;Later!
2820;AE070BD;Look closer! We are EDF!
929;AL008DA;Gah!
1163;AM078BE;Let's talk about it later!
5852;AE201_015;Aliens on the land and in the sky. Are we still on earth?
884;AM002BA;Everything alright?
608;AC024DC;Let's go.
2546;AZ036Q;And don't worry, if you break it, we'll bring you another.
2885;AM195BC;That's the answer I get after seeking what I want.
3001;AA038DA;I think it's because you've gained weight that you can't fly faster.
861;AY071BC;It happens.
1616;AH026BC;Captain, I won't let you die!
1920;AE202_084;Despair gets the best of us.
7846;AE141_098;The human civilization is collapsing. It's very likely we will never rebuild our world if we lose more forces.
2095;AE142_017;Let's rendezvous with the troops in the rear first.
1475;AC004CA;Confirm enemy position!
1351;AY062DD;I shouldn't have done that.
1652;AE150_027;Couldn't you inform us earlier?
1891;AD010BB;Let's do it! Don't miss!
772;AY029DD;Hehehehehehehehehehehehehe
1316;AM173BD;You saved my life!
1785;AE104_002;Those things are attacking the city!
3771;AZ001PA;Congrats! Now you know the top secret of EDF.
935;AY061BA;I'll be more careful.
813;AE161_002;ADVANCE!
1823;AE186_004;Get rid of the flying aggressors!
1394;AE112_010;They were all destroyed.
2769;AE003_044;The lieutenant was killed in action. Eaten by a monster.
1896;AE145_019;Mothership overhead. Stay sharp.
499;AM029AC;OKAY
2967;AE108_020;Civilian, I promise I'll take you to a safe place.
520;AM079BD;Yeah!
2726;AE123_018;We have an emergency. The alien army is landing.
1399;AM114BE;That's absolutely wrong.
1335;AN025BE;So, you're my boss?
2168;AE121_017;Fencers, move in! We'll cover them!
1386;AM085DC;Stop the nonsense!
2277;AT304DD;Awesome you saved my life
751;AM170BD;Thank you!
733;AM040AB;Stop it!
2237;AI005DD;Stabilizer confirmed! Abnormal!
1173;AM090DC;I won't forget this.
1251;AR017DA;One person is missing!
1205;AR019BD;ONE MAN DOWN!
2210;AE004_009;INCOMING! MONSTERS!
1292;AM108DB;No worries.
1952;AN025DB;Wing Divers will secure your safety.
977;AQ006DB;I'm dropping!
1190;AM085DA;Stop the nonsense.
660;AP017BC;We did it!
1903;AL019V;Everyone check the equipment now!
2211;AE123_006;Should we prioritize saving civilians?
1028;AE161_025;They're rolling at us!
569;AB001Z;Let's go!
1871;AE148_019;The robots are coming again!
696;AG003DD;Attack!
845;AO007Y;I'm out of bullets!
17599;AE103_037;This is a follow-up report on the UFOs. A…monster has appeared in the same area where a UFO was previously sighted. It is said to be 10 meters long, extremely aggressive, and will most likely attack humans. Stay tuned for more updates.
1446;AL042BC;Uh, I'm alive!
1284;AN024AA;So, it's you.
1039;AC005AB;Prepare to engage!
1464;AM149BC;That's probably the case!
2371;AE144_029;I'll assist you from now on. It'll be my pleasure.
1123;AEX04_176;Secure that building!
375;AM026DD;Got it.
822;AE032AC;More to the right!
888;AY067DC;No problem.
3389;AQ005X;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
3798;AZ007G;DE-202 to Air Raiders. I'll wait for instruction up here.
703;AY019DC;Hahaha
2269;AS011BB;Let go of me! Let go of me!
1366;AM118BB;It's only your fantasy.
1061;AE111_031;About two months.
9786;AE199_035;Their plan of wiping out the entire human race is proceeding as planned. Now they want to eradicate all artificial creations associated with us?
382;AM040Z;Ugh!
6752;AU122AB;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
1318;AE198_071;Arcela's incoming!
558;AM055AC;Cut it out.
1492;AT203BC;Go save the ones caught in the web!
2750;AE138_022;This is Scout. There are countless monsters!
3421;AE190_011;Duty once again. When do we get some vacation?
2018;AEX04_530;There's a monster teleportation device!
691;AM091X;Whoa!
2218;AY048DB;From now on, I'm part of your unit.
1245;AM086DD;Did you take it wrong?
1583;AF012AB;Don't waste your shots, they'll find us.
1066;AB011BE;WE'RE RUNNING AGAIN?!
1071;AA121BC;I'll kill them all!
1048;AM041Y;You're absolutely right.
1113;AK011BB;Are there more enemies?
1404;AC004BB;Please leave it to me next time.
3158;AE126_015;If we don't attack the pylons, there won't be an end to it!
2916;AE199_033;Wingdivers deployed as backup. Rendezvous on site.
660;AY067BE;No problem.
1294;AE194_005;Destroy the drones!
1646;AA026AB;We are invincible soldiers!
1758;AJ015BA;Someone give us instructions!
951;AE179_054;Try again!
3118;AE186_045;The queen is bringing an army of flying types with her!
1996;AEX04_219;Harsh weather won't affect those things!
2364;AE210_082;How could this be? How?
979;AA039BB;Are you petrified?
1033;AI009BC;Support me!
427;AM043BE;Got it!
2418;AT103BB;Set me free! Set me free!
1800;AF026BE;How long before we can engage?
1790;AH004BB;Don't die! Stay alive!
1888;AM175BA;Because I'm the ally of justice.
1619;AE163_021;Hey, what are those?
903;AG007AB;Engage!
1012;AM065BD;That won't work!
1099;AE047BA;I see our chance!
1817;AA048BD;No one can beat me in poker.
1003;AO008BA;I'm out of ammo!
1166;AM153BC;Ah, is that right?
4820;AE158_040;If we run into shield bearers in the future, break through the light barriers to destroy it.
849;AD001AC;Prepare to shoot!
4082;AE136_012;The new mysterious monster keeps drawing near! EMC, regroup!
2462;AA054AC;Be careful not to accidentally shoot one of us in the dark.
1630;AEX04_467;CONFIRMED DEATH QUEEN!
7369;AU011AB;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry, we are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1543;AN004AA;Don't worry, I'll protect you.
778;AG005V;Let's start!
2949;AE210_027;Aaaaaah!
1387;AU002W;DESTROY THE WEB!
1113;AEX04_173;Guard this river!
1260;AR009DB;Isn't the captain here?!
1203;AF009BA;Captain, let's attack now!
2107;AR013DA;Report! One diver fell!
627;AM030DC;Understood.
1005;AP008DA;One defeated!
695;AM132BA;Is that so?
1855;AI006DA;Is the shock absorber overloading?
1158;AM119BC;Just you wait.
2517;AA094BE;I'm not afraid of the enemy, but the darkness.
2614;AN017BD;A commander is required for the mission. Thank you.
2747;AZ006I;Ready for firing! The bombing can begin anytime!
564;AC018AB;PLANET!
9006;AE211_083;The enemy commanders right before our eyes. No matter how many sacrifices we make in the future, we will never get this opportunity again.
873;AEX04_089;Open fire!
1702;AE104_067;Could it be? Aliens?
817;AM033X;Negative
629;AM117DC;Shut up!
1104;AE027BB;BRING IT!
2309;AA045AB;There are enemies hiding around. Stay focused.
1221;AM072W;I owe you big time.
2903;AA016DD;I think this equipment is best for fighting monsters.
2632;AE110_026;Is there nothing we can do about those aliens?!
2634;AE200_011;Negative! Too many! We can't proceed!
4497;AE160_004;A night raid. We wouldn't be so troubled if this strategy worked.
2696;AA054AB;Be careful not to accidentally shoot one of us in the dark.
2205;AE154_001;The aliens are protecting those monsters!
1846;AK010BB;Hey! We've got a job to do!
3643;AE126_008;Pylon guards confirmed! Aliens are protecting the pylons!
2106;AE105_061;All members are equipped with Equipment D.
784;AY014BA;I'm healed.
2627;AE185_007;The bridge won't hold if the monster gets on it!
2087;AE051BD;NOW! ATTACK THE ARMS!
1562;AEX04_605;Sniper Team in position!
1836;AE139_019;Newbie, you rock!
939;AE100_030;Not bad.
1562;AL041BA;We can call it a day, can't we?
1444;AZ034Q;We'll send over another one later.
819;AY055BD;I'm going to sleep.
867;AN011BD;I'll defend you.
1576;AL001BB;GAAAAH!
1460;AE119_058;Ground units, good luck.
2671;AE198_029;Barga Six here. Suffered moderate damage.
896;AL016CB;That's great!
938;AM158DD;What's this?
845;AL016CA;That's great!
1129;AZ013L;Submerging at once!
618;AM028W;YES!
2126;AE112_057;Excellent skills! Impressive!
1963;AR009BA;Oh my gosh! Captain!
2137;AS011BE;Let go of me! Let go of me!
1225;AO009BC;The bullets don't come out!
828;AM162BE;I'm grateful.
1940;AEX04_719;Barga is on its way. Hold your ground.
408;AE197_026;What?
2771;AA024BD;I've got some juicy steak, I'll cook some tomorrow.
1979;AK003BB;The scout reports that the enemy is sighted.
3319;AE173_024;Residents have been killed? What are we fighting for?
1062;AEX04_198;Get some rest here!
887;AP012BA;IT'S FINISHED!
803;AEX04_085;Target hit.
1117;AM165DD;I don't believe it!
706;AE162_015;ADVANCE!
4428;AEX04_311;Confirmed mutated mysterious monster. It looks even more powerful.
1332;AP015DD;Pray eliminated!
3480;AE148_016;Aim at their feet! Destroy the cannons on them!
1721;AC017BA;Don't die! Stay alive!
3684;AE109_016;They are tougher than the black monsters! This is hopeless!
4135;AE211_092;You want unequipped civilians to fight?! Have you gone mad?!
1106;AS007AC;Figure something out!
1207;AD016DC;Can I pull the trigger?
634;AN002BC;I'll back you up.
1038;AB002AA;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
2018;AE112_030;Sergeant is there a chance of winning?
1020;AM206BE;Is that how it is?
2117;AR009BC;Oh my gosh! Captain!
1569;AG005X;Let's play it the hard way!
4369;AE150_016;We've put in our best effort, and yet we still fail to defeat it.
1469;AD008AC;Too far! Close in!
1614;AEX04_229;The fog is getting thicker!
2132;AA137BD;FENCERS ARE THE STRONGEST SOLDIERS
1167;AR001DC;The captain is...
876;AY032DB;I'm sorry.
1106;AM034ZA;What are you thinking?!
6745;AU142DB;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1165;AA051DC;I have a smart brain.
1670;AR015BE;Report! One man died!
868;AM012CA;I'm impressed.
1636;AO009BB;THE BULLETS DON'T COME OUT!
1238;AE006BC;WATCH THIS!
2395;AE002_175;Don't worry, civilian. We're safe now.
972;AM155BD;Either way!
1461;AE002_116;Hey! It's this way!
1399;AE142_023;New type confirmed!
1447;AE196_002;Attack the monster!
2307;AE129_056;Hey! The base is moving!
7693;AU131BC;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1061;AM022Y;I understand, sir!
3110;AE104_068;Flying saucers! Flying saucers are coming out!
3714;AE002_166;But this is the only route. We have to exterminate the monsters!
2789;AE181_007;He has controlled the barber before, he'll be alright.
1782;AE114_016;Head straight to the central plaza.
336;AE100_009;Huh?
1470;AT007AC;Damn it! Let me go!
835;AM015CA;I'll remember it.
3232;AA016W;The situation's tough, but our operation plan is nice.
1776;AC007DD;SENSOR HAS DETECTED ENEMIES!
1418;AM006BD;I'll figure out something!
841;AM073BA;Not possible!
1768;AA046DA;Have you been able to contact your family?
1483;AO002AA;Reloading ammo
638;AY022BC;Hahaha
2012;AE153_016;Concentrate your fire on the same spot!
3431;AA012Y;My dad used to say, a day in the army settled for life.
1769;AE180_022;Just a scratch, nothing to worry about.
1701;AC023BD;Uh, are we gonna fight?
320;AM156DA;What?
1986;AE002BA;HUUUUUUUUUUUGGGHHHH!!!!
2496;AL009DC;Ahhh!
1050;AM065BC;That won't work.
665;AM018DA;Nice!
2499;AB001W;HAAAAAAAAAA
747;AM081DA;You're wrong.
723;AM162BC;I'm grateful.
3624;AE193_007;The teleportation device is summoning the gamma species!
1393;AEX04_371;Mothership is descending!
1144;AR025BE;Bring me a coffin!
1657;AD002DC;Beyond weapon effective range!
1649;AR007BA;I will avenge our captain!
2085;AF004CA;Move forward carefully. Don't get caught.
1407;AE129_011;Monsters are close by!
1832;AA068DC;Why did you quit being a civilian pilot?
1478;AE153_009;AND THERE'S ONE IN THE REAR!
1526;AE171_011;GX1, attack!
952;AZ004M;Target confirmed.
1983;AE071BA;NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ALLOWED
675;AZ018PA;Shoot!
1514;AA122BC;I can't wait to start the fight!
903;AM024V;Next time!
1118;AE021AC;Take aim at the left!
3061;AE196_004;The entire urban area is covered in webs!
924;AL039BA;Can I get a medal?
2965;AA038AC;As they say, it's a winnable battle, and we will win!
605;AM044AA;Indeed.
2740;AT311DA;It turns out all I heard is true. Thanks.
1502;AE148_007;They're standing up!
1404;AE141_065;Dude, you made it!
986;AP018BD;Did you see that?
6040;AE183_012;The winged aliens are the alien larvae we encountered from before, which will metamorphose into aliens.
2948;AE176_076;That's why our first objective is to recover that base.
2412;AS001EC;AHHHHHH!!!
2082;AN006BE;You're only a civilian, but you are brave.
3809;AE123_027;Although some people expect dialogues, that's not what we're seeing on the scene.
1560;AN031BE;It's my pleasure to meet you!
2353;AEX04_312;CONFIRMED GIGANTIC ARCULUS
1406;AD011BA;They're almost in range!
1112;AT101BD;SAVE ME!
3763;AT303DD;You destroyed the web! I'm alive, all thanks to you.
487;AM062CA;WHAT?!
1041;AE004BA;FIRE!
1484;AG004BC;The enemy is closing in!
1619;AE171_010;GX3, moving in!
1254;AM194BB;Because I like it.
681;AM045AC;Sounds fair.
659;AT112DD;HELP!
1707;AL005DB;Woo-hoo!
3537;AE120_018;They're calling monsters for aid. Exterminate the monsters!
2199;AK012BB;I got a bad feeling about this!
1488;AEX04_392;They're coming out from the nest!
642;AQ003CA;AHHH!
2043;AM009AB;Stop whining and start shooting!
2353;AE002V;AHHHHHHHHHHHH
1325;AE028W;ATTACK IT NOW!
2572;AA131BE;It's hard to control a powered exoskeleton.
8562;AE202_074;We are soldiers. We fight in the real world, not in an imaginary one. Don't forget that there are still men and women out there who rely on us.
1175;AM021W;I understand, sir!
5411;AE190_001;Take those aliens head on. They have a huge army. May the infantry prevail against the enemy.
789;AY052DD;Bye-bye.
1483;AE111_004;How big is the alien army?
1396;AE114_082;One alien remaining!
1804;AM140BE;It will definitely come true.
6575;AU032CA;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
2341;AE004_054;All aliens on the ground have been exterminated!
2378;AE194_013;The reinforcement is on its way. Hold your ground!
938;AF018AA;I'll finish reloading.
1580;AC015DD;Activate the shock absorber!
2299;AM195BE;That's the answer I get after seeking what I want!
2592;AA019CB;Remember to have the wings repaired when going back.
1490;AEX04_301;CONFIRMED SURVIVOR
1078;AM084W;I'm surprised!
748;AY067DA;No problem.
1496;AEX04_560;Support the unit in combat!
1602;AM158BD;You had a dream like that?
1055;AL016DB;We did it!
563;AM020CB;All right.
1061;AP012BC;IT'S FINISHED!
2055;AEX04_586;Shotgunners, charge enemy lines!
1545;AM140BC;It'll definitely come true.
2332;AA088DA;I feel like I'm assimilated with those bats!
2140;AE100_007;Howard exoskeletons are coming, watch out!
2213;AA087BE;I don't want to fight those things in a place like this.
4507;AE133_044;This victory means a lot. We'll transfer the data all over the world.
1233;AG004CB;Prepare for battle!
1680;AR026BA;I WANT REVENGE!
1510;AA077DB;You can't fly too high here.
866;AN009BE;Let's fight together!
1432;AM111BD;It only seems like that.
580;AG001CB;NOW!
1383;AE114_010;Flying saucers approaching!
1174;AL011DA;E-D-F!
2522;AA038DB;I think it's because you've gained weight that you can't fly faster.
1044;AM052AB;Pfft. Wrong.
500;AI001AB;Medic!
2612;AA058AC;Stick together. You're screwed if you get separated.
554;AE210_003;Move in!
2580;AI017BC;No, I can't fight anymore.
2882;AE002_029;We were ambushed. Everyone else is dead.
1590;AL004Y;HA-HA!
3381;AE163_049;This is Scout. We've confirmed a large group of flying objects.
1296;AE144_044;A mothership is approaching!
635;AM059BD;No way.
3369;AR004DD;Oh no, the captain is... Contact the headquarters!
5630;AE143_064;Are they some poor indigenous creatures brought by the creators of the civilization from who knows what planet?
1469;AR035BC;Dan got shoot up!
1865;AZ002G;This is Fighter, ready for attack!
631;AE005DA;SHOOT
1512;AM157BA;Let's talk about it next time!
2917;AE116_020;No pets allowed here. Somebody should tell them.
1102;AM126BB;Don't get it wrong!
1738;AA083BD;We're not lost, are we?
5637;AE210_063;The enemy ship has a lot of firepower, but this is humanity's last chance! Destroy the command ship!
1076;AY046DA;Let's fight together.
1478;AM019AA;This is what we're trained for!
4376;AE111_028;A new type? Does that mean there's a way to destroy the teleportation ships?
1079;AY039DD;All yours!
5034;AZ008PB;I'll keep your secret for you, but in return, you have to tell me the enemy's position.
2494;AA033Y;I used to like someone, but that person died.
1312;AP007AA;I took one down!
2085;AE155_027;Destroy the web and save those being trapped.
2281;AE159_052;MONSTERS ARE COMING OUT FROM THE NEST!
7498;AU161DD;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
1023;AE040BD;HAVING FUN?
2260;AA040AA;Think about triumph under all circumstances.
1171;AE144_035;More flying types!
1800;AE115_035;Let's kill all aliens!
1395;AM019BD;That's amazing!
1348;AE177_033;Let's protect the ladies!
2017;AM112DA;Can't we talk about things more interesting?
666;AM210BC;OH!
383;AY025BE;HA!
2728;AE107_034;Keep shooting! Take down the monsters!
1129;AG011BA;The enemy's here!
1036;AY016BA;Mission complete!
4931;AE205_036;All available units, assume attack coordinates. Take down the mothership.
1233;AY033BA;I'm disappointed.
732;AG001DD;INCOMING!
1020;AR001AC;You killed my men!
2834;AEX04_617;This is Wing Diver. We've arrived at combat area.
6634;AU162V;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We travel our foes day and night
2330;AE177_046;That's the true power of Spriggans!
570;AM020AA;Great!
603;AY069BA;Don't worry.
1403;AJ003DA;Isn't the backup here yet?
2960;AE144_041;The garrison was annihilated within such a short time.
1831;AA016CA;Always check how much power you have left.
714;AC024DB;Let's go!
1144;AA007DB;The wind is refreshing.
2735;AA027X;Now I've got no one to share my heroic stories with!
1978;AA101DD;Wing Divers are the best unit!
2694;AR001ZA;Raise your weapons and get revenge for your allies!
1412;AEX04_124;Artillery unit deployed.
1826;AM040DA;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
4543;AE147_005;Since we can hardly destroy the mothership, we will just focus on attacking the drones for now.
3348;AE109_024;Shoot the monsters dead, even if you get bitten!
37002;AEX02_037;We are facing a critical situation. The number of aliens on Earth are increasing as we speak, while human population is declining. Soon, we will be the minority. And in the near future, those aliens will be the rulers of this planet. What then will become of us humans? We will have to beg for survival, and maybe they will establish reservations where we will spend the rest of our miserable lives. But even if it is a road filled with humiliation and disgrace, we will have to survive as the indigenous people of Earth.
1333;AI005AC;Cover me while I recover!
1315;AT108AA;Someone break the web!
1249;AE149_036;Watch the situation now.
785;AY069DA;No worries.
698;AO014DA;Landing
2084;AA045BB;Let's see who kills the most enemies!
8528;AE210_032;Number two is starting to move as well. Wait, all mother ships are moving. They've set course for our area.
1362;AA003X;Is this a soldier's duty?
408;AZ024Q;Take him.
590;AY038BA;Greetings!
997;AM030AA;Let's try it!
4247;AE135_026;Our equipment is perfect for dealing with agile opponents, so leave them to us!
3259;AT107DC;Stay away! It's a trap!
1324;AJ004DA;We lost our commander!
1074;AA048DC;Is there someone you like?
1959;AL019AB;Looks like they're eradicated completely.
714;AE005CB;Attack!
919;AY006DA;I owe you one.
1792;AA021V;I will get you home alive!
889;AC008DB;It's our turn.
1625;AA010BB;I'm not trained for this!
3073;AE158_010;Are you nuts? This operation is reckless!
3099;AE112_024;We lost half our men! We have to retreat!
1734;AE129_039;Aliens are disembarking!
1992;AE185_011;The monsters are falling into the veil!
3095;AE131_014;If we don't destroy the nest, we will be in big trouble!
1833;AEX04_595;Rocket launchers! We're counting on you!
1213;AY071DD;It happens!
484;AM024AB;Approve!
562;AY068BE;It's all right.
1379;AE149_022;Guided missiles?
944;AB015BE;MOVE! MOVE!
461;AM211BE;WHAT?!
630;AE179_049;This is it.
1493;AE001Y;Aaaaaaahhhh legend criteria
1504;AR027BE;The newcomer got chewed up!
1314;AF005W;Are we going to attack now?
993;AY061BB;I'll be more careful.
693;AH001BA;WATCH OUT!
648;AM030AC;LET'S TRY IT!
745;AM052DA;No way!
2397;AL037DD;I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
765;AE201_002;Advance!
1018;AY074BE;This all worked fine!
552;AB011DD;Whew!
1951;AEX04_240;The sandstorm is getting worse!
1512;AE179_046;Stop whining and get moving!
1500;AE117_014;Could it be the monster's nest?
4623;AE131_039;This is good news for mankind. Looks like there is hope in exterminating the monsters.
1963;AA068DB;Why did you quit being a civilian pilot?
1433;AE012BA;DON'T LOOK DOWN ON ME!
803;AY032DC;I'm sorry.
1834;AA101DA;Wing Divers are the best unit.
617;AH001BC;Watch out!
1437;AY077DD;Hey, we're buddies!
1110;AEX04_066;Target shot down!
1053;AD005AB;Mark the target!
1413;AA052BE;Getting used to pulling the trigger?
12756;AE117_046;Because it is biologically much more different from species alpha and species beta, it might need its own classification, so we will call it urgent-ness from now on. Strategy talks are underway as we speak.
1383;AE014CA;Dodge their attack first!
758;AM073AC;That can't be!
580;AE005_043;LOOK!
589;AN010BD;Goodbye!
934;AA005V;FOLLOW ME!
1188;AY004BE;I barely escaped!
757;AE007AC;ATTACK!
711;AM055DD;I can't do!
1081;AH011BA;We'll fix you up later!
1550;AD020DC;Flying combat, ready!
1249;AE132_031;The cave has been secured!
4621;AE122_002;The drones are in alert mode. When they hit, the drones around them will switch to combat mode.
1035;AE121_062;Fall back, now!
1473;AE190_032;Launching Artillery Strike
1293;AS001DC;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1601;AK002V;It's them! They're coming!
1015;AM116DD;I got that!
2004;AE136_009;Attack with EMC now!
2014;AD003DB;The enemy is outside the shooting range!
4186;AE156_010;Araneus's threads can be shot from a long distance. We must keep a close eye on them.
3471;AE106_012;Blue means alert mode. Red means combat mode.
1371;AA036X;Why are you willing to fight?
774;AP002Z;Who's next?
1317;AG017BD;Fire! Fire!
1384;AR037BD;Ray got chewed up!
2858;AE105_031;Face the reality! It's an alien invasion!
1471;AE121_067;SHOOT DOWN THE DRONES!
13790;AE211_015;If it's in the command ship, it must be someone important. Maybe it's their ruler, like a king or emperor, or it could be their military commander. Either way, this is going to be devastating to the primers.
1838;AC008BE;We are almost in the enemy's range.
1100;AD005AA;Mark the target!
671;AE112_052;It worked!
1822;AR006BD;Captain! Please reply!
769;AM168BA;Thank you, sir!
1787;AE126_004;Contact! Monsters!
986;AY026DB;Ha ha!
2203;AE104_054;Abort attack and leave the combat area!
14763;AE115_004;We are smaller in terms of size, so it should be hard for the enemy to see us. As long as we don't attack them, they won't notice even if we get close. So try to get closer to the enemy to attack them. All we need is courage.
1035;AG006AB;The battle begins!
6919;AU172CB;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end!
1073;AT301AA;Grateful for your help!
1880;AA077BB;Where does this cave lead to?
1645;AE068BB;You regret coming to Earth?
2764;AE164_004;We have confirmed numerous shield bearers!
788;AM034Y;I can't do that.
882;AZ005L;Launch Ready!
7120;AU012BD;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
1643;AH005CB;Confirm damage of the wings!
2262;AE116_008;The monsters aren't attacking the aliens!
3457;AE105_028;Goddamn terrorists. I promise I will make you pay
837;AL020BA;We did it!
785;AY058DB;I'm sorry.
632;AY015DA;I'm back!
1153;AM054BD;I'll take care of this!
2606;AE163_027;Could be birds! Their wings are flapping!
709;AM058W;That's cool.
3028;AT303DA;You destroyed the web. I'm alive all thanks to you.
1065;AE010CB;KEEP GOING!
2179;AA055AA;I will bring you back to the ground, no worries.
3616;AI005ZA;I will bear the pain and continue to fight! That is being tough!
723;AR002DB;Captain!
1922;AE112_015;That is not the problem.
1396;AA002DB;I'm better than anyone else.
1372;AT108DB;I'm caught in the web!
1780;AE105_063;This is Hummer. We're in position.
2110;AA017CA;If you keep moving, you won't get hit easily.
3143;AE113_018;We wiped out most of the monsters! Only a few remain!
1144;AT002ZA;I'm stuck in the web!
416;AM020Y;Gotcha!
861;AO009AC;I'm out of ammo!
2419;AE143_016;They come crashing down! Watch out!
334;AM153DB;Eh?
1926;AA062AB;Don't lose to infantry, got that?
2034;AEX04_418;Even a direct hit won't kill them!
2852;AE190_022;We'll launch an air raid to take out the sniper. Hold on.
1245;AE100_036;Something wrong with the circuit?
1850;AE204_014;From now on, we're Rangers!
1555;AE113_023;Calm down! Kill them all!
3269;AE168_016;The fog has cleared up, now we can at least see some things!
1008;AM014BD;AMAZING!
1614;AL018BE;It was the last one remaining!
1168;AM163DB;That's ridiculous!
1597;AA053DB;That guy keeps looking at me.
1167;AS004FC;STOP IT!
434;AM043BA;Got it!
2214;AF012AC;Don't waste your shots, they will find us.
1282;AA005DB;I'll fly higher next time.
1457;AE006_007;Fight the flying saucers!
6887;AU122DB;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
3565;AA142BD;I used private powered exoskeletons for cargo shipment before.
3178;AE111_032;So that means it'll be to our disadvantage for the next two months.
1751;AM146BE;You play too many video games!
1344;AE166_015;THE ALIENS LANDED!
6437;AE147_029;This type of drone will be called Type II drone from now on. We'll start to work on countermeasures.
6937;AE172_008;Remember that shield bearers will move once they detect incoming intruders. By then the light barriers will change positions too.
8270;AE105_078;Hoards of flying drones incoming! Everyone, find your cover! The enemies are drones! You won't be attacked if they don't find you! Hide now!
1943;AA060DA;What's the reason you joined the EDF?
956;AA003ED;Save me!
640;AO002DC;Reload!
1521;AL018DA;Plasma Drive cool down.
1661;AO018BC;Reload, reload!
2376;AA082DA;I should have worked harder on my night flight training.
1255;AM147BB;You watch too much TV.
1840;AEX04_380;CONFIRMED! GIGANTIC ARCHILLIS!
1924;AE001_034;NO!
917;AM072X;Thank you, sir.
1695;AE146_035;I'm so glad to be alive.
1153;AK011BA;ARE THERE MORE ENEMIES?!
1086;AN016BB;I'll help do the mission.
3007;AE127_031;Ahhh! We can't hold down anymore!
2457;AM008AC;Treatment can wait! Take down enemies first!
1357;AM158BA;You had a dream like that?!
2252;AE143_028;It's anchors! A lot of them!
4093;AE141_001;I will destroy the base even if I have to sacrifice myself. Cool.
1126;AZ023I;Initiate bombing
383;AM026CB;No.
2342;AE200_024;The wing divers have been dispatched. Meet up with them.
3784;AE137_008;It's dangerous if you aren't close enough! Just get right under that thing!
695;AP005BB;Bullseye!
4342;AE001_045B;We don't know what they are and how many there are, and we don't know how they infiltrated us.
539;AY059BB;Pardon me.
7171;AE156_019;You won't get tangled by Arrhenaeus' threads if you use vehicles. Entering Arrhenaeus' range by vehicles is also a choice.
2757;AT305DA;You saved me, right? How should I thank you?
1690;AF015AB;Don't jump the gun! Wait for my order!
1560;AA066BA;Do you have any reasons to fight?
2363;AE117_036;Want to keep moving? You are brave.
1632;AO023BD;Reloading is easy peasy.
562;AM014DB;Great!
1695;AG002CA;Let's start flying combat!
1411;AN031DC;I'm all yours, hero!
1460;AF006X;Is there any attack signal yet?
3048;AA041Y;I'm good at walking in narrow spaces, but enough is enough.
3593;AA142BE;I used private powered exoskeletons for cargo shipment before.
1617;AE153_038;We will defend the infantry!
680;AM001W;You alright?
1140;AY060BC;I apologize.
2746;AE155_026;DESTROY THE WEB! SAVE THOSE BEING TRAPPED!
2469;AM141DB;There's no other choice than fighting, am I wrong?
1254;AL010AA;Exterminate it!
1748;AF010BA;We should be able to take down the enemy now.
1418;AEX04_179;Guard this paddy field!
2068;AY048DA;From now on, I'm part of your unit.
2051;AE103_024;The monsters are increasing in number!
791;AI009BB;Support me!
1087;AY031DB;What a shame.
2633;AE185_016;Spotting a group of species gamma near the beach.
2141;AC009DB;System normal, ready to engage.
1809;AA100DC;I'll never get defeated by monsters.
509;AQ003DB;Ahh!
1203;AEX04_162;Defend nearby area!
2882;AE135_023;The sniper team is in position. Relive it with them.
757;AP005DD;Defeated it!
1198;AS007BB;Somebody help me!
1253;AM184BB;This is for my lover.
908;AC001BB;Ready for battle!
898;AL025DC;Landed safely.
1541;AR020DD;I'll save the fallen one!
2232;AE159_051;Team 3, joining force with Team 1!
2629;AA031CB;It's really a rare opportunity to fly in a cave.
1287;AEX04_004;BEGIN OPERATION
2394;AEX04_678;Team Cougar, providing support now.
1682;AH009DD;We have to protect the injured!
1830;AE104_065;It's as large as the city!
3877;AE121_035;We are here to protect the city, but I didn't expect this site.
568;AY068BB;It's alright.
1716;AEX01_012;Spriggan unit here for support!
1744;AF004BC;It looks like the enemy can't see us.
2127;AE162_016;Destroy the remaining teleportation ships.
2836;AA004BB;I'm confident of my shooting. Just count on me.
3818;AE158_032;Aliens protected by the shield bearers are hard to handle, so stay sharp!
1378;AE004_019;Something is coming out!
2083;AN005DC;I'll protect you until we leave the battlefield.
3980;AE186_009;They won't be a threat as long as the queen isn't here. Now kill the flying type!
1351;AE151_012;Thank you for coming to the rescue!
1992;AE002_104;Why aren't the rescue teams here yet?
949;AC003CA;Prepare for battle!
4033;AE155_016;As long as there are people who need our help, it's our duty to face the enemy!
1467;AJ010BD;Should we really stay here?
1887;AC008AC;Be careful! The enemy is around!
2601;AR043BD;Comrade! Leave the rest to me!
1568;AF005AB;Now, the enemy didn't notice.
1368;AA013DA;I don't regret anything.
1997;AY041BE;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
1812;AA049BD;I'm a gambling genius.
2268;AF004AA;We can get close to the enemy without notice.
3413;AA125BC;Poor enemy! They have to fight us!
1459;AF003BC;I think we can approach them now.
382;AM036Y;NO!
1213;AM182BB;This is for my family.
1454;AM027BC;You deserve my praise.
1255;AD002BE;The enemy is closing in!
2699;AE154_015;The operation was a success! Return it once!
1412;AM193BA;I've always wanted to do so.
1122;AM056DD;That won't work!
524;AE104_050;Great!
703;AY019BA;Ha ha ha!
481;AY022DD;Hehehe
1247;AE002_025;How can they be so big?
1630;AC004BD;Please, leave it to me next time.
2772;AE130_043;Operation failed. All units retreat.
3065;AA020W;I've always thought that we should use our manpower efficiently.
1344;AC009AC;End of chit chat. Let's go!
833;AY029BB;Teehee!
2617;AO025BA;RELOAD! I'm so good at this!
1120;AF015CB;Don't waste bullets!
546;AQ001FA;AHHH!
473;AM086Y;Really?
6828;AE158_024;Those shield bearers will deflect any objects they see as threatening. Our reverse operation seems to be working.
1593;AE186_006;ATTACK THE FLYING TYPE!
1123;AE195_012;IT'S A KING!
569;AE002CB;AHHH!
1418;AH019BB;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
1793;AE109_005;Shush! I think I heard something!
1947;AEX04_230;The fog got thicker than before!
871;AM166DB;What happened?
2637;AE194_029;I know! Eliminate the rest of the enemies!
2066;AS002Y;GAAAAAARGH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
4854;AEX02_025;I had five brothers and sisters! Now, I'm the only one left!
671;AM059CA;What the-
1522;AE068BD;You regret comin' to Earth?
423;AM024ZA;All right.
404;AQ002EC;NO!
875;AG012BD;Come here!
3092;AE106_030;Well done, Sergeant. Destroy the rest of the drones.
1791;AQ012BE;I'VE BEEN SHOCKED! UGH!
6401;AE118_002;We are professional monster exterminators. But don't let your guard down. You'll be dead if you get hit by the acid.
555;AM028AC;Approved!
6809;AU142BD;Here, still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1341;AA013DC;I don't regret anything.
3495;AE128_060;It's still possible. Once it rains, they'll all drop dead.
2510;AE128_016;This is Scout. Aliens are approaching.
2009;AT205AA;Destroy the nest! Save our men!
1007;AM086BE;So that's how it is.
1234;AP013DD;That one is killed!
709;AE138_001;Advance!
1671;AE150_009;I'll just apologize in advance.
1149;AF009W;Act quietly.
819;AM116DB;I got that!
5356;AE210_055;It's the egg! It's the egg! We found it! That's the egg-shaped spaceship!
606;AM016BE;Great!
2371;AT002AC;I'm caught in the web! Get me out of this!
935;AM063W;Yeah, maybe!
1436;AN025BA;So, you're my boss.
663;AM062DB;I think so.
1922;AA101DC;Wingdivers are the best unit.
667;AM115BE;You're wrong.
834;AP014BD;One kill!
1743;AE131_051;Burn them to ashes with this!
2882;AA110BB;Being a soldier is awesome! You can get a pension!
2419;AE131_049;The reinforcements have arrived. Go join them.
1769;AM005AC;We're soldiers! Hang in there!
704;AM042CB;That's it!
1567;AI006AC;I'm injured! Cover me!
1386;AR029BE;The boss got chewed up!
2345;AA031DA;Plasma Drive, low output activated.
1494;AE049BE;NOW! ATTACK THE HEAD!
780;AM025W;Understood
3249;AA028X;All my friends died. How should I spend my holidays?
1912;AEX04_726;THE REINFORCEMENTS ARE HERE!
1504;AE110_024;It's not working at all!
2636;AI015BC;Damn, I feel dizzy.
2114;AE103_015;At this rate, it'll become a monster nation!
1866;AA045BC;Let's see who kills the most enemies.
660;AM083BE;I agree.
1505;AK012DB;Is there no end to this?!
1826;AF033BD;And it also leads to victory.
774;AS004EB;Let go!
2704;AA022Z;It's only a split second. Don't worry.
3313;AL008W;E D I E F
684;AG007BE;We're found!
554;AM067AB;You did it!
2682;AN032BD;I'm so happy that I can fight together with a hero!
13466;AE141_080;The enemy is gearing up for a large-scale airborne operation, dropping off aliens worldwide. They might launch some larger attacks in the future. Now we're at the crossroad. This war might be coming to a conclusion soon.
1156;AY032BE;I'm very sad.
724;AD008BC;INCOMING!
841;AM009CA;That's great!
3207;AA012Z;Grim reapers will die for our brothers, understand?
1173;AK002AA;The enemy is here!
697;AZ017PA;Fire!
1825;AH006CA;Need a thorough check on the wings later.
2135;AE117_031;Wingdivers, meet up with the assault team.
1774;AE171_017;GX-5, ready for combat.
1048;AK001BD;CONFIRMED THE ENEMY!
3767;AE202_063;So what if they destroy a city? They're deserted anyways!
1790;AE178_005;It's now an enemy base!
1832;AH007AB;Be careful! We're in enemy's rage!
6370;AE195_006;Multiple teleportation anchors are scattered across this area. They will continue to teleport monsters if we don't destroy them.
1693;AY057BC;When this is over, I'm out.
2749;AC014BC;The enemy is near. I'll take care of it.
936;AM123BE;That's not right!
2559;AEX04_545;Contact! Enemy coming from the north!
964;AB009CA;Let's fly!
2388;AD012AB;We'll miss the target at this range. Hold your fire!
723;AY014BE;I'm healed!
1327;AA072BB;How is this happening?
1384;AY055BA;I'm going to sleep.
908;AE129_015;Something flew by!
14131;AE147_036;Autonomous battle robots. They will act on themselves once they land on the ground and destroy everything around. Their combat strength is phenomenal. We might need to sacrifice a whole team to simply take out one robot.
805;AM115BD;You're wrong.
2397;AEX04_269;Confirmed. Silver species beta.
1400;AF005BB;But the enemy didn't see us.
961;AE002_079;FOLLOW ME!
2134;AE144_010;The sky is covered with monsters!
1239;AL014BB;Neutralized!
620;AG001DC;Incoming!
2098;AL036DD;We won! I can't believe it!
1471;AH014BB;I'll check on your wound later!
815;AM121BD;WRONG!
1858;AE157_029;Can we destroy the shield bearers?
766;AC003AB;Keep your guard up.
1559;AEX04_157;Missile has hit the target!
907;AM115DC;I suppose.
1186;AE019BC;Hey! Now!
645;AY027BC;You're funny.
1803;AEX04_421;Thread-shooting monsters are here!
2179;AA070DB;I can still fly even if we're underground.
2458;AA040Y;What have I got myself into? This is nuts!
1157;AM200BE;It's a long story.
2175;AE166_022;Are these alien heavy infantry?
749;AM011CA;Remarkable!
951;AO009Y;I can't fire!
588;AL018AA;Good job.
1970;AE204_004;Slay those monsters!
1328;AT001DD;I can't fly!
2027;AI004X;I'm injured! Be gentle!
2530;AA055BD;I'll buy you a nice meal if we come back alive.
1657;AE157_006;They're getting close in the fog!
877;AE186_020;We're going in.
611;AH003BE;Evade!
2686;AT008BC;It uses its thread to capture its prey to eat!
1968;AN028BA;You to be our captain?
1214;AL019DC;Enter the cool-down mode.
4338;AE140_007;We already sent your coordinates to the Grim Reaper. They should arrive momentarily.
1485;AY064DD;I didn't mean to.
535;AQ001DC;AHHH!
2794;AE070BB;Look closer! We're EDF!
1049;AH017BB;Keep your cool!
1024;AM037V;That's wrong!
970;AP006V;Did you see that?
1197;AF002DC;The enemy hasn't caught us.
1746;AJ002BB;The situation is terrible!
1393;AP009BC;We hit it, next!
363;AM052BD;Got it!
607;AM035AB;Next time.
1188;AC001DC;Go, go!
2053;AZ027QB;Carrier to aerators, vehicle dropped.
982;AE002_019;SAVE US!
1262;AM130BB;Just you wait!
3489;AE210_117;Damn it, we won't stand a chance if we don't destroy that shield.
908;AM073DC;Totally agree.
594;AR002BA;CAPTAIN!
409;AM038BA;Okay!
1949;AEX04_249;Since when did we ever have an advantage?
938;AQ005DD;I got shot!
243;AB008DC;HA
997;AR023BA;Damn it, he died!
927;AY059DD;Pardon me.
1810;AF013AB;Don't shoot yet. Let's keep approaching.
3099;AN002Z;The newbie. Try your best to stay alive.
1434;AE131_021;IT'S THE ALIENS!
2032;AA008BB;It's just fighting. Easy.
2421;AL001Y;Yaaargh!!
907;AP002V;We got one!
1304;AM111DB;Can we change subjects?
1029;AM141BB;You're so funny.
4558;AE186_011;Our movement speed is handicapped by heavy anti-air missiles. We need the inventory's support.
919;AP006BA;We got one!
1563;AU001Z;Ugh! My body!
1563;AE194_027;Damn it! It's getting away!
318;AE146_016;What?
9608;AE106_008;But the colour of the drone is the key. A blue drone is in alert mode and is presumed to be harmless, so the drones that glow in blue are not dangerous.
1850;AA015CA;Don't depend too much on stabilizers.
742;AM078DD;I got that!
1613;AE186_029;The nest is tilting more!
1158;AM113DB;I'm not interested.
739;AH020BB;We're hit!
1941;AR011BC;Captain, I won't forget you!
1626;AE210_049;This is their command ship!
1277;AS003DC;HEEEEELP!
903;AO002BD;Reloading ammo.
722;AE004ZA;AHHH!
2341;AA040AC;Think about triumph under all circumstances.
2848;AE162_031;It escaped? Does it mean it was afraid of us?
2505;AF011DA;Let's sneak up on an unaware enemy and beat it.
3884;AEX04_519;Monsters are being teleported in! It's those teleport anchors!
6563;AE135_031;We have confirmed a group of flying type. A giant organism likely to be queen has also been detected.
3276;AR002Z;I'll be there in a second. First, I must take revenge.
1083;AM140DC;I've made up my mind.
696;AP009DC;One down!
1673;AO008AB;Cover me while I finish reloading!
1765;AE114_038;Look! Something is in there!
3137;AA093BB;Thinking that the enemy is in the dark makes me get cold feet.
1416;AG001AA;NOW, SHOOT!
1674;AD012BA;Show it to them once they're in range!
1671;AZ025J;Machine gun fire, start!
1516;AE129_055;Why is it shaking like this?
2876;AE104_013;Destroy the pylons before they ruin the city!
1709;AN006DC;It's my job to protect civilians.
978;AP014DA;Target down!
1116;AZ017G;Target confirmed.
636;AM004BC;I'll help you.
773;AE005_020;We did it!
1765;AE190_025;The Air Force will be here any second.
853;AY020DD;Hahahaha!
2107;AE016AC;Keep shooting until all enemies are down!
1853;AEX04_609;Sniper Team, we're counting on you.
3106;AE173_020;The creature will be called Death Queen from now on.
1166;AY016DC;Mission complete!
2569;AE155_007;A vanguard should be here too! Find them!
10068;AE193_012;They managed to put this device underground without us noticing, so they can teleport monsters to the Earth at will. The situation is getting out of hand.
2200;AN021AA;I've heard about you. Let's fight together.
2278;AL015AC;We did it. Let's go for the next enemy.
939;AM002BD;Everything alright?
8562;AE145_069;The outer layer is covered with a protective armour that is bulletproof, but its most important function is to prevent them from getting harmed by air pollution.
6615;AU172BE;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end!
2091;AE115_027;We can't expect anyone to rescue us!
832;AM001BD;Hold on!
1855;AA009Y;Guess I have to cancel my holiday plans.
756;AP004CA;Direct hit!
2225;AL050BC;It feels great to come back triumphantly!
1470;AD016BB;Into the range, come on!
1535;AZ024H;HOW IT'S YOUR FIRE!
1679;AE205_012;FLYING ALIENS SPOTTED!
1360;AM086BD;So that's how it is.
1083;AE177_039;Coming from the sky!
1907;AO012BB;Damn! My magazine is cracked!
19053;AE211_059;We recognise thought as electric signals generated by our brain. The so-called superpowers are only a fantasy of ours, or should I say, a delusion. But if an intelligent lifeform evolves from thousands or even tens of thousands of years, maybe it can eventually reach that stage.
596;AO001CA;Charge!
725;AM013AA;You did it!
1688;AE190_033;CONFIRMED ENEMY LANDING SHIP!
1547;AI006DC;Is the shock absorber overloading?
2387;AF006CB;They haven't found us. Good opportunity.
1419;AY077BC;Hey, we're buddies!
881;AY047BA;I'll fight with you.
1224;AA004AA;Check your surroundings.
556;AE100_035;Again?
1520;AL011V;ALL ENEMIES ARE TAKEN OUT!
953;AG003AC;OPEN FIRE!
2498;AA013X;I've dreamed about myself making big money.
648;AM072AC;Are you sure?
2063;AQ009AA;AHHHHHH!!!!!
830;AA111BC;Do you like the army?
1839;AA138BA;How can we lose to the wing divers?
790;AE118_014;Attack!
1703;AR043BE;Comrade, leave the rest to me!
6810;AU132X;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
1002;AM105BB;I knew it!
3738;AE207_015;It's absurd! All nearby aliens are swarming this way!
1280;AEX04_050;Enemy count, three.
2148;AE139_020;No way I'm calling you a newbie again!
1952;AA006Y;No one told me it's a dangerous operation.
911;AM035BB;Sir, yes sir!
784;AQ001BC;AH-HA-HA!
589;AZ020O;LAUNCH
910;AM139BC;That's the rumor.
1553;AEX04_209;THIS FREEZING RAIN!
1216;AT203DC;Someone is caught on the web!
2308;AA058AB;Stick together. You're screwed if you get separated.
3149;AN009DB;Because there's no commander here, we'll join forces with your team.
924;AS004DB;Stop it!
607;AA005FB;Stop it!
2060;AEX04_653;Grim Reaper, support the infantry units!
1252;AO009BD;The bullets don't come out!
1856;AT309DD;You came! Thank you!
737;AE017DA;HIGHER!
2106;AF033BC;And it also leads to victory!
898;AA074BA;Where's the enemy?
1223;AA074BD;Where is the enemy?
894;AR001DA;The captain is...
661;AD008BB;INCOMING!
1256;AM151DD;Money is important.
2756;AE003_029;There are too many enemies! Evacuate the civilians!
1182;AC003W;Entering the range!
751;AB002CA;Follow me!
1104;AE202_044;Situation confirmed.
2962;AE107_025;Everyone, look! It's a large flying saucer!
529;AY052DC;Bye-bye.
1345;AA084BC;Can't see without light.
2179;AF030BE;Not yet, not yet, not yet!
2082;AEX04_664;Spriggan unit, support the infantry unit.
1452;AM128BC;YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
2956;AE139_021;You're no gosh darn newbie, you're our ace!
743;AM159BB;Thank you, sir.
3098;AE134_011;Aliens are being dropped from the teleportation ships!
6601;AU132AB;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
1034;AA043Y;Let's take a deep breath.
1081;AY028BE;That's funny!
1143;AE006_010;Attack the monsters!
1563;AL033BA;We took down all enemies!
1319;AE105_001;What the hell is that?
616;AEX04_558;Engage!
3302;AE145_058;Those aliens, they take buildings as shields!
840;AM082BD;I think so too.
2243;AA032DD;Diagnostic system activated.
7945;AE186_058;The attack was a success. We've hindered the flag types for multiplying. Good job.
11185;AE126_016;Those pylons will be called teleportation anchors. Their weak spot is the glowing device on the top. If we only attack the top part, we can destroy them with infantry firearms.
636;AO002Z;Reload
1021;AR012DA;An ally fell!
1020;AR002BC;Captain!
1248;AE210_087;Sending out reinforcement.
562;AM063BE;Can't do!
942;AA080BE;You'll get lost!
1193;AM063X;You're always right.
1966;AO010W;Out of ammo at this critical moment?
492;AE111_025;DAMN
3880;AE186_046;Why would it return just now? Did it sense the nest was in danger?
925;AM001CB;It's all right!
21520;AEX02_039;There's some good news for the brave Minutemen who have joined the fight! The government has decided to grant you the same benefits as that of a regular soldier! Every Minuteman will benefit from this policy, with no exceptions! Now sign up at the EDF facility! New privileges and new responsibilities await!
7479;AU011Y;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1721;AE115_016;Good, let's strike now!
922;AF008X;Can I attack?
2309;AEX04_561;A unit has engaged the enemy, sending backup.
2158;AE100_006;Powered exoskeletons, make way!
2031;AE178_022;They don't want to see the base taken away!
2198;AEX04_593;Rocket launchers! Get ready for battle!
1094;AE211_134;So there's no hope!
1798;AL019BA;We just killed the last one!
996;AY064BB;I didn't mean to.
2616;AR007W;I just told the medic your position! Stay still!
329;AB008DB;HA!
507;AY001BB;Thanks!
1257;AA025DB;Aerial unit checked.
1186;AT003DC;I got stuck in the web!
932;AY005DB;I'm in your debt.
1222;AE041AB;Keep the formation!
2347;AEX04_368;CONFIRMED! MYSTERIOUS MONSTER URGINOUS!
1341;AM050DB;That's way too hard.
1003;AN023DB;I will protect you.
1155;AM008BA;Rescue's on the way!
2766;AE159_064;There is more than one queen guarding this nest.
938;AE005_045;PERMISSION TO ATTACK!
1794;AT201CB;Rescue our buddies caught in the web!
2427;AZ009M;Epimatheistic Ground Forces, best of luck.
1037;AEX04_643;Join the FENCER team!
1174;AE034AB;I'll leave the right to you!
1274;AC006AC;Remove the safety device!
387;AQ001AB;Gah!
1807;AA086DD;I really can't take this!
961;AY055DC;I'm going to sleep.
693;AM001CA;It's all right.
2359;AE210_141;Is that God?
1066;AM058DD;That makes sense!
1485;AA059DB;Why did you join the EDF?
1424;AA029DA;Flight system all checked.
979;AY067BA;No problem.
1100;AEX03_001;There are webs!
949;AM004CA;Don't hold back!
909;AM023AC;That's amazing!
1752;AZ049G;I gave it all I got! Sweet!
422;AM021CA;Got it!
2269;AK013DC;Detected a reaction. What's this?
3567;AE002_007;Aim at the enemy, then pull the trigger. Easy, huh?
4340;AE178_003;We have confirmed several teleportation anchors, apparently inactive at the moment.
3209;AE130_032;The Requiem Cannon did not cause damage to the enemy!
1123;AR025BA;Bring me a coffin!
1820;AO010DC;Weapon system, cool down!
1598;AT202DD;Someone is stuck in the web!
981;AL006CB;Yeah!
875;AY019DD;Hahaha
2667;AE004_049;Fall back! Fall back!
2841;AE115_010;Hold your fire! If they find us, we're doomed!
1147;AG006CA;The enemy is here!
2791;AE002_124;I'm ready to fight, but not against so many.
2262;AY048BB;From now on, we are part of your unit.
3503;AI005Z;I'll wipe out all enemies first. Hell can wait.
2202;AA099DD;Flying in the sky is reassuring.
1395;AJ010DB;We don't have a commander!
970;AA037DC;Did you gain weight?
358;AM034DD;Got it!
2451;AM178BC;Because I can't let them take over the Earth like that.
1442;AR022DD;This is unforgivable!
1152;AS002DC;AHHHHHHH
2013;AT105BB;I can't move! Somebody help me!
717;AH001AC;Evade!
1170;AL012BB;Mission Cleared!
1652;AZ009H;Hey! Get ready!
2091;AA084DC;I hate dark places.
6874;AE146_054;Although I don't want you to be so reckless, you are our only hope now. Keep on fighting and defeat all the aliens.
1482;AE181_031;Arceles has been defeated!
3842;AE136_018;How can that be? Its vital force is stronger than Urginus's.
2535;AA024ZA;Our night flight experience will come in handy here.
699;AM117BB;You mistook it.
1665;AH012BE;We'll give you some medicine later!
1019;AM073DD;Totally agree!
1198;AL021X;Did you see me today?
2850;AT008BA;It uses its thread to capture its prey to eat!
490;AM065DA;I see.
1873;AE004_017;Look! Something's piloting it!
1113;AM110BC;That couldn't be true.
1517;AY057BA;When this is over, I'm out.
3193;AN020AB;I've heard rumors about you. We'll give you a hand.
2610;AE002_034;This route doesn't work. Let's head back.
1709;AE135_009;The flying monsters are coming!
1237;AN024AC;So, it's you.
1899;AE001AB;YEAH!
642;AM023Y;Yes sir!
1107;AL011DB;E-D-E-F!
7770;AU171BC;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1275;AE177_025;Let's move, quick!
322;AY025DA;Hmph.
720;AM157DA;Do you mean it?
2982;AE134_005;The enemy seems to focus on dropping monsters in this area!
1314;AR004Y;What if our man has been killed?
5371;AE121_032;Currently there are five alien bases around the world each of them was dropped from the sky
699;AM117DD;Shut up!
1008;AD013BE;It's too far to shoot!
3631;AE210_072;It's firing!
1142;AF017AB;Check the equipment now.
2094;AD006ZA;Shoot right after you enter the range!
948;AA004AB;Check your surroundings.
1186;AE054BD;Attacking now!
3310;AE128_037;Enemy artillery unit on the rooftops. They're attacking this way.
1161;AI001DA;The wings are abnormal!
1101;AR012DB;And now I fell!
2914;AE176_052;Hey, what the heck? We don't have time for this!
546;AY002BB;Thank you!
574;AN010BC;Goodbye!
1885;AD017BD;Shoot them dead once they're in range!
1059;AY073DD;It's nothing.
9422;AE210_022;The operation to take down Mothership 3, which landed in North America, has failed. But concentrated fire on their giant cannon seemed to have done some damage.
861;AM005BB;I'll back you up!
1037;AB009BE;They want us to run!
788;AM006ZA;AMAZING!
2205;AT304BA;Who destroyed the net? I must thank him.
7794;AU121DA;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
924;AL018Y;That sucks!
1176;AA056DA;I hate idiots!
3159;AE149_009;This type of robot will be called Deroi from now on.
3984;AE198_037;Barga's six-year. Armor has been breached. Output decreasing fast!
465;AM211BA;WHAT?!
8374;AE211_067;If it can distort space, it should be fairly easy for it to escape. Why is it still here? Why doesn't it just leave?
7679;AU021Y;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1211;AE178_004;There are aliens too!
2058;AE058BE;AHHHH!
1713;AT304AB;I'm finally out. Thank you.
1505;AE134_002;No sign of them giving up!
2439;AD012CA;Wait until the target is in range before you attack.
1673;AA054DC;Beauty is a sin, indeed.
1490;AE106_019;Aren't the rescue teams here yet?
1746;AE120_001;Commence night flight. Let's go.
1845;AE202_034;Damn it! Have we lost our race?
514;AB004Y;Dash!
1261;AE017BB;I'll shoot you dead!
2006;AE111_009;Why are the aliens doing this to us?
1995;AU002Z;Destroy the web! Along with me!
1198;AE185_001;SECURE THE BRIDGE!
1547;AE105_054;GAAAAAAAH!
7217;AE158_043;This is the first time someone has destroyed a Shield Bearer, and we even have survivors. You're amazing!
4036;AE156_003;This is Wing Diver! We got stuck to the web! Cannot move!
1728;AEX04_396;Red monsters confirmed!
6651;AU142DD;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
659;AM096DD;No!
816;AA041DA;Are you shaking?
1430;AA051BE;I'm the best singer.
2827;AE144_026;So, that is the main source of our problem.
2347;AT002DA;Wings are unable to stretch!
978;AY003DC;I want to thank you.
2125;AQ005Y;AAAAHHHHH!!
1539;AEX04_539;IT'S OCCULUS!
2120;AA030BB;Following the orders can't be wrong.
1866;AN004BE;It's my duty to protect civilians.
899;AA076BC;Did you hear something?
2232;AE176_078;Retreat, and stop agitating Arcellus!
2476;AE207_019;It will create a huge blast when it hits the ground!
1327;AG014BD;It's coming this way!
1028;AC003X;Let's do it!
2748;AE169_008;The giant monsters appear to have high combat strength!
1643;AG015BE;The fight starts now!
1233;AB007DA;MOVE! MOVE!
1009;AA005AA;Watch your backs!
1713;AJ008W;If the sergeant were here now...
1896;AE190_009;Don't let the fencers have all the fun!
3325;AE137_003;Their number is shocking, and they didn't even pay attention to us!
341;AE159_061;WHAT?!
2237;AA023ZA;The ceiling is low here, so be careful.
4077;AE199_022;That's correct. If we don't do something, every single building will be gone.
3518;AA092DB;But it seems that aerial units were supposed to be military technology.
2844;AE210_006;We have railguns, they'll go there for sure!
1114;AA034BC;Don't go crazy.
1807;AT106AA;Over here! Save me!
1603;AN005V;Don't go crazy newcomer!
1669;AE001_025;I'll show you the way, follow me.
2054;AE152_002;Good. Commence operation.
2272;AE108_008;It's Species Beta, and they're coming!
663;AM051CB;Thank you.
1679;AA002X;It's a nightmare! Must be!
1061;AL005Y;YEAH!
444;AM208BB;WHOA!
1718;AO010CA;Weapon system, cool down!
2323;AE112_039;We're getting a Medal of Honor for this if this works out.
1076;AR001DD;The captain is!
637;AH015BE;ARE YOU SHOT?!
2754;AA004W;I analyzed the situation, but still couldn't get it.
730;AM050BB;SOUNDS GOOD!
2505;AN007BB;A civilian, then I can't leave you alone.
1422;AE146_058;That was really a close call.
1608;AL045BE;Boot camp is nothing like this!
966;AA075BB;Is something over there?
3058;AE126_013;There should be several pylons. Find and destroy them.
1065;AE028BD;WATCH OUT BUDDY!
2115;AI015BA;Damn, I feel dizzy!
2136;AE066BB;AHAHAHAHAHA!
1964;AG017BE;Fire! Fire!
1276;AE002_018;Hey, there are too many!
1832;AN018AA;Never thought I'd be under your command.
1295;AM009V;Protect the patients!
685;AN010AB;We'll defend you.
1265;AR009AA;DEFEND THOSE DOWN!
3586;AA129BE;Only the powered exoskeletons can carry this heavy weapon.
7941;AE112_056;Amazing job. Well done. This vital information will bring us closer to victory. I'm sending it to the whole world now.
997;AM019BB;That's amazing!
2621;AE014AC;WE WON'T LOSE IF WE GO BY OUR TRAINING! SHOOT!
2770;AE148_026;We have confirmed! Something is coming down from the sky!
1555;AE119_014;Initiating battle system!
1183;AE004_070;What exactly are they?
882;AM085BD;That makes sense.
1097;AM137DA;I've got no choice.
4918;AE177_004;I risk my life to escape from that base, really don't feel like going back.
1408;AM148DD;I want to be an idol!
775;AM009Z;Sweet!
1451;AE113_045;It must be onto something.
740;AM019DC;AMAZING!
3267;AE127_032;We're surrounded. There's no way out!
1260;AM063AB;You did a great job.
2312;AE002_027;Kill them all! Spare no one!
1068;AP015BD;We got one!
1398;AE058BA;AHHH!
2993;AE145_075;It's over! Call off the operation! All units retreat!
939;AP026BC;That's one!
2579;AE114_029;You mean aliens that look like humans?
6090;AE104_042;Time to wake up, this is such a wild dream, there are no such things as monsters.
1811;AI019BE;Damn! It's painful!
2760;AD012AA;We'll miss the target at this range! Hold your fire!
1900;AN024DD;I'll protect you. That's my task.
2405;AEX04_447;THAT FLYING AGGRESSOR HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR!
520;AM155DB;Really?
1782;AR007BC;I will avenge our captain!
2794;AE141_104;Come from Beijing. Victory is ours.
878;AM207BD;Oh my!
1713;AY057DA;When this is over, I'm out.
574;AE016DC;Faster!
1042;AP003ZA;Hit confirmed!
4796;AE162_010;Hooligan cannons firing in three, two, one.
2050;AE179_047;Yes. Yes, sir.
1339;AF004DC;Now's the best time to assault.
1212;AA063BA;How about singing a song?
2369;AE128_005;Damn! The rain is blocking my vision!
2401;AE114_074;I've never killed anyone! I can't do this!
1941;AE136_006;Finish Ergenus with ground forces.
1142;AN012BD;I'll fight with you!
1050;AE148_006;Have we been cursed?
1035;AK002DD;Enemy confirmed!
807;AEX04_138;Operating.
1675;AEX04_324;Species gamma incoming.
861;AE023BE;EAT THE BULLET!
1099;AF012CB;Keep it cool.
2334;AE002_066;This is it! I'm opening the gate now!
3996;AE128_023;AHHHHHH!!
2516;AA039DA;If you want to fly faster, lose some weight!
1343;AL014W;CHECK THE EQUIPMENT NOW!
1306;AE157_007;Aliens are descending!
1116;AM050DA;That's way too hard!
1088;AE010AB;Concentrate your fire!
1354;AA066BC;Do you have any reasons to fight?
1489;AL036BB;It's finally over.
2020;AE133_042;We're surrounded by the monsters!
2233;AEX04_675;Delta here! We've confirmed target!
1315;AA008DA;A nice breeze of wind.
3823;AZ036H;Let's call it a day. No more requests for today.
1109;AE190_006;ADVANCE!
1564;AE138_055;Railguns, stand by!
660;AQ001AC;AHHH!
1203;AA037DD;Did you gain weight?
2425;AE209_001;Enemy forces are converging on our location.
852;AM015CB;I'll remember it!
2953;AW002W;You saved me, right? I'll definitely return the favor.
1349;AK008DB;I feel an enemy nearby!
3469;AE197_007;No casualties! We are going to destroy those teleportation anchors!
698;AM021X;Sounds good.
627;AE140_027;YOU AGAIN!
1088;AM022AA;I'll remember that!
1998;AI020BA;I've seen worse. This is nothing.
5683;AE150_036;We're unequipped to do any serious damage to the mysterious monster. We should focus on the teleportation ships now.
2138;AI015BE;Damn! I feel dizzy.
1569;AR005DB;The captain is gone!
431;AM019CA;Do it.
1433;AA006BC;We must take them down!
814;AD004BB;Ready to shoot!
3062;AE138_050;Epsilon self-propelled railguns have reached the target point.
1066;AB003CA;Move forward!
929;AL019Y;Will I get a raise?
562;AM207BB;Oh my!
6709;AU112AB;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
784;AY067BD;No problem.
1658;AE158_026;FENCERS. KEEP ON FIGHTING.
1761;AE060BB;Don't come! Stay away!
1666;AE142_024;We've got monsters here too!
7762;AU121DD;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
890;AP014BB;One killed!
1091;AE131_004;Take out the patrol!
6795;AU112BD;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong!
2018;AE202_021;You mean it cleanses our environment?
1003;AP014BE;ONE KILLED!
1682;AE179_051;All clear. Let's continue.
3460;AA027CB;We can't perform at full strength here. Don't let down your guard.
495;AA038BC;Cover me!
2221;AE006_003;Attacking the mothership right from below might work.
1447;AE150_017;The raid was a success!
1152;AA084BE;Can't see without light.
1169;AE005_034;Yeah!
1768;AE113_002;Exterminate the monsters!
1522;AY021DD;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
1857;AN004BC;It's my duty to protect civilians.
477;AM060DC;Correct.
1685;AA035X;Why did you join the EDF?
918;AM027Y;Sir, yes sir!
620;AM017BA;We did it!
3558;AE105_045;Did you hear that? She says casualties are not important.
1106;AR031BD;Joe got chewed up
1308;AC003DA;I will follow the plan!
2842;AE118_019;Her bullets are like tiny mosquito bites!
3529;AA021DD;With the power of the plasma drive, this kind of enemy is nothing!
1128;AM079AB;I can't believe it!
638;AF002CB;Quiet!
1398;AE001_036;IT'S TOO HUGE!
2131;AE182_010;We have to! Everyone else is dead!
617;AY038BB;Greetings.
2863;AT306BD;Did you destroy the web? Thank you for saving my life!
595;AM027X;Roger!
2442;AE127_015;I have to say, there's so many of them!
7707;AU171DB;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
6071;AE121_027;The base is protected by aliens and monsters. Attack the enemies around the base and break through their defense.
3336;AE206_011;There's too many. We need more than ground units.
602;AM017DC;Good job.
1871;AY021BC;Ha ha ha ha!
1966;AR040BD;Victim! There's a victim!
1995;AA084DD;I hate dark places.
1978;AY035DC;So sad...
1580;AEX04_096;Hooligan cannon, fire!
2414;AEX04_268;CONFIRMED. GOLDEN SPECIES ALPHA.
2056;AEX04_654;Grim Reaper, we expect much from you.
3436;AA027CA;We can't perform at full strength here. Don't let down your guard.
907;AL006BC;We did it!
1910;AN003DB;I have no choice. Come with me.
795;AA111BA;Do you like the army?
1085;AA121BB;I'll kill them all!
1223;AT102CB;I CAN'T MOVE!
1193;AD020BE;Crap! Too far!
1340;AO005DD;Weapon Power, Link!
1641;AC020BC;Remember what I told you yesterday?
4386;AA013Z;Our lives depend on the spears. Remember to take extra care of them.
1084;AZ012K;Drop the bombs!
1185;AT206DB;Save our partners!
2019;AK005Y;The scout team seems to have spotted enemies!
3104;AL006Y;Aaaaaaaahhh!!!
1995;AA009ZA;Spriggan's have to be intimidating.
1430;AE114_066;They are firing at us!
1018;AM135DD;Thanks for the help!
2885;AY011DA;The EDF doesn't leave its men behind. It's for real.
3132;AA088BC;I didn't expect to really go on an underground adventure.
982;AM186BE;This is for a living!
1406;AK009AB;We still have work to do!
2539;AEX04_685;This is Bull. We've reached combat area.
1287;AE024BC;Take my bullet!
822;AC011AA;Keep watch.
1994;AR008V;I'll get the medic! Wait here!
1889;AE186_048;The Queen is approaching! Destroy it!
3268;AL001V;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
1579;AO018BD;Reload. Reload!
1884;AT203BB;Go save the ones caught in the web!
342;AM030BB;Got it!
1016;AZ017Q;Well done, civilian!
2572;AZ014H;An order from a civilian?
1090;AM031V;Sounds reasonable.
627;AY024DB;Hmm.
1001;AE032BA;Great chance!
506;AZ019PB;Beam!
1266;AR003W;ONE MAN DOWN!
2806;AE190_026;The air raid is starting. All ground troops, fall back.
1499;AEX04_121;Request artillery support!
950;AM006W;You're great!
1363;AF006BE;The enemy is off guard!
1857;AE198_087;Storm One, board the barga!
3372;AE131_073;Great. Replenish ammo, and then continue the mission.
707;AQ001EA;Ugh!
2180;AE206_023;I can't believe the fight is still going on!
2652;AE121_057;Aaaaaaaarghhh!
1749;AA050BA;I'm more courageous than anyone else.
2484;AE131_026;Maybe they are actually subterranean beings.
2274;AE042BD;Did you see that? I'm unmatched!
1359;AO030BA;I'LL CHANGE THE GUARD'S RIDGE!
1068;AZ020Q;Vehicle drop.
988;AY018BD;Should be clear!
3280;AEX02_021;This is a rescue chopper. What is the location of the wounded?
677;AQ003ED;AHHH!
1002;AE121_011;Attack the drones!
1241;AT001BB;AHHHHH!!!
2421;AE105_026;Unmanned killing weapons, huh?
6715;AU152DD;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
409;AN010BE;Goodbye!
601;AJ003BC;Crap!
1041;AE118_013;Attack Urgenus!
1040;AP010DB;Destroyed
2891;AA130BA;Thanks to the powered exoskeleton, it feels weightless!
1404;AE132_015;Faster this way
2302;AEX04_239;That's one hell of a sandstorm!
1407;AL020DD;Switch to cruise mode.
948;AE159_058;Attack the nest!
4109;AE141_060;Just as I thought. Our attacks are useless against the Golden Armor.
2945;AA124BC;They shouldn't have run into us. Tough luck for them.
962;AM132DB;You saved me!
338;AM058BD;NO
3040;AA142BA;I used private powered exoskeletons for cargo shipment before.
899;AY047BD;I'll fight with you.
1507;AE103_043;A flying saucer?!
602;AQ002Z;Ugh!
3554;AA019DD;It's safe in the sky. There are monsters everywhere on the ground.
1801;AR011BB;Captain, I won't forget you!
1167;AM213BA;WHAT IS GOING ON?!
2034;AL014Y;Victory! Did you see that?
534;AM038AB;NO!
2325;AEX04_562;We've called for backup. They will be here any time.
2147;AE192_004;Destroy the eggs. Every single one of them.
553;AM075Y;Thank you!
933;AM017DD;Good job!
884;AA002Z;Stay alert!
3522;AD009AA;Not close enough! Let's wait for the enemy to get into range first!
1096;AT301BA;Thanks for saving me!
2262;AEX04_465;There's the queen! This doesn't look good!
907;AK008BB;Here's the enemy!
1367;AE117_044;Kill all monsters!
2590;AEX04_425;CONFIRMED! AGGRESSIVE ALIEN SPECIES BETA!
1754;AE143_009;Don't expect reinforcements.
815;AP003DC;We got one!
2432;AA101BB;Really hate to step on the battlefield.
670;AE006DD;ATTACK!
733;AM027ZA;Yeah, sure.
2784;AE164_011;Don't go too far, you might become sitting ducks.
832;AP005DB;Defeated it!
1507;AD020DA;Flying combat, ready!
3484;AE210_045;Cannons those flying things have carrots
1750;AE119_017;This is Cold1, enemy located.
2200;AE159_001;Divide into three teams and advance.
662;AY053DB;See you!
906;AB004V;Follow me!
976;AEX04_259;Ambush the enemy!
1585;AEX04_323;Species Beta incoming!
1261;AE153_040;Next three, Roger.
2366;AEX04_130;Neutralize the enemy with satellite bombing.
7677;AU111W;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters crush them one by one.
940;AM082BA;I think so too.
904;AM057DD;Just quit it!
1180;AD016DA;Can I pull the trigger?
959;AE113_011;Monster sighted!
1098;AC005AA;Prepare to engage!
752;AE199_008;THEY'RE HERE!
1589;AE111_018;THEY'RE DROPPING MONSTERS AGAIN!
4376;AE105_057;Yeah, when can I wake up from this nightmare? I'll wake up in my bed, right?
1071;AM067CB;Oh my gosh!
2152;AF002BE;Looks like the enemy can't find our location.
967;AY062BA;I shouldn't have done that.
653;AY001DD;Thanks!
1664;AI008BD;Bring me the medicinal supply!
2635;AT003BD;It's pulling me away! It's so strong!
2070;AO010BC;Oh no! I'm out of ammo!
1280;AZ012PB;Target locked on.
1684;AE192_011;We can't handle this!
1605;AL027BB;I took down the enemy!
3124;AE170_007;Those are no ordinary drones. Many were killed by them.
979;AY006BB;I'm in your debt.
2587;AE121_064;Drones! They're hunting us down!
2129;AL021DB;Plasma Drive, energy saving mode.
1051;AM100DA;You watch out!
445;AM087X;WHAT?!
621;AM105BA;I knew it!
3112;AA093BD;Thinking that the enemy is in the dark makes me get cold feet.
1514;AE131_054;We will catch up to them soon!
1315;AS006BB;Somebody, help!
1640;AN023BD;You're lucky. I'll help you.
1034;AM018AB;That's worth a medal!
2589;AA029Z;Work with your partners, don't get separated.
2607;AE114_065;What? No! Back off!
1976;AR040BA;There's a victim! There's a victim!
628;AE017DB;Higher!
1898;AEX04_222;The snow should be slowing them down too.
1625;AEX04_279;Confirmed. Alien.
1928;AEX04_102;GOLVERIN CANNON! FIRE!
387;AY025BA;Hmph.
1103;AE027W;We're in combat!
1383;AO020BE;WHY CAN'T I FIRE THE BULLETS?!
463;AM156DC;What?!
1901;AE129_037;Flying objects are closing in!
5569;AE117_030;Wingdivers have headed inside to scout. They should be somewhere nearby. Meet up with them as soon as you can.
1073;AY073BC;Not a big deal.
1010;AM026W;Sir, yes sir!
1002;AEX04_170;Secure this road!
1228;AY017BE;Easy peasy.
1758;AE179_064;IT'S THE GIGANTIC UNLOADER!
2715;AS011BC;Let go of me! Let go of me!
1148;AM012Z;Don't get carried away!
348;AP003BC;Hit!
3085;AE211_017;God, that is God.
1073;AJ004BB;What should we do now?
1575;AE140_035;What an impressive man!
1654;AE177_016;There are heavily armed aliens!
1541;AE180_007;Let's take them head on!
586;AY024DA;Hehe
1789;AE142_038;We can't penetrate them with bullets!
2036;AT306DD;You're my hero! Thank you!
1220;AE131_022;Aliens confirmed!
996;AR013BA;ONE MAN DIED!
1942;AE001W;YEAH!
1959;AEX04_656;Grim Reaper, show us what you've got!
1993;AL003DA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2107;AA032CA;The night flight training is coming in handy.
2020;AA099DB;Flying in the sky is reassuring.
6810;AU032DB;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
1867;AEX04_623;Wing Diver, engaging enemy!
1274;AA048DA;Is there someone you like?
2653;AE198_046;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!
1839;AE142_021;Ah, there's someone I can count on!
1672;AF017DA;We could be spotted once we attack.
797;AK002W;THEY'RE HERE!
2159;AR004BC;Oh no, we lost our captain!
1148;AA039BD;Are you petrified?
2185;AEX04_199;Just a few more steps and we can rest.
4247;AE112_028;This is Outpost 2-6. Flying saucers are swarming in. Request for backup.
938;AM108BD;That's not right!
1859;AEX04_686;This is Ball, engaging enemies.
4566;AE001_047;Before the reinforcements arrive, we are on our own. That is why I'm arming you.
910;AA067BE;Why are you here?
7641;AU021DC;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind could still exist out here in paradise
1338;AA008DC;A nice breeze of wind.
761;AQ004CA;I'M HIT!
1294;AM144BC;Was it in your dreams?
2278;AE187_006;There are almost no survivors in the city.
5168;AEX04_247;I doubt that. We, on the other hand, have lost visibility. That's gonna be a disadvantage.
1072;AE138_023;Drones incoming!
963;AM168BD;Thank you, sir!
2069;AEX04_687;This is Tiger I, moving in.
2367;AE134_015;The Air Force has suffered heavy casualties.
3160;AA115BE;I only did training. Now I'm doing the actual fight.
1122;AG016BB;IT'S SHOWTIME!
1267;AE198_044;AHHHHHHH!!!
1156;AE210_104;Is that?
950;AY020DB;Ah ha ha ha!
1590;AY057DB;When this is over, I'm out.
2219;AE202_053;Are they trying to get rid of us once and for all?
1052;AY060BB;I apologize.
1501;AE001_016;Answer me! What happened?
823;AO004Z;Recharge
980;AA037DA;Did you gain weight?
1289;AEX04_147;Running Cooling System
3472;AE132_035;To be honest, I'm really scared. Good that you're here.
2221;AA024AB;Willpower is all that matters to a soldier.
1215;AA117BC;The mission is too hard!
1383;AL022DB;I must save the energy.
2609;AEX04_506;Glowing domes! They reflect our attack!
3351;AE146_030;I got separated from my men. I'm gonna search for them.
6967;AU022DC;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
817;AP006BB;We got one!
1170;AT005DD;I'M PULLED IN!
2127;AN002X;Hey rookie, happy to enlist?
1876;AA032DC;Diagnostic system activated.
550;AM161BE;Thank you.
1259;AEX04_333;CONFIRMED! DRONE!
2101;AN005AA;Don't die on me. I'll protect you.
1348;AH010BA;The man will check on you later!
3299;AE211_123;It's all or nothing. Looks like our last shot.
1757;AL024DB;Landing, machine as normal.
2121;AE121_021;There are more drones than expected!
2342;AE163_042;Fencers. Divers. Go for support.
1960;AM179BB;Because I can't keep myself out of this.
2358;AM178BB;Because I can't let them take over the Earth like that.
1355;AE149_018;ARE THOSE MISSILES?!
1771;AM091DC;Don't spread false info.
2362;AE004_068;They are aliens in space suits!
2641;AE171_019;Keep those monsters away from the powered exoskeletons!
1844;AA102BD;Tell my family I fought bravely.
2390;AF009AC;Move to a better position before the enemy finds us.
981;AE211_132;Everyone's dead
2018;AE131_023;I didn't expect to see aliens here.
1658;AM139DC;We can never let go of the enemy.
2859;AE119_005;The powered exoskeleton is making strange noises!
1207;AM035V;You're absolutely right!
3683;AEX04_316;We'll call the enemy's mobile base Club Giga from now on.
651;AC019AB;Plan B!
1309;AC018DC;Switch to active mode.
1287;AC007AC;Safety device disabled!
1075;AA072BA;How is this happening?
2283;AEX04_691;This is Tiger I, Beginning Attack.
2389;AEX04_674;This is Charlie, entering combat area.
806;AE009BD;Gotcha!
400;AM021Y;GOT IT!
1456;AI022BD;No way I'll die.
2824;AE107_013;SILK THREADS! SILK THREADS!
1384;AA058BD;Let's hang out tonight, everyone!
2187;AE182_004;This big anchor has been activated!
1374;AM048CB;Completely wrong!
1172;AM020DB;We can't lose!
1050;AE032BD;Great chance!
1745;AE128_054;Aliens coming from behind!
1598;AA096BA;I wanna breathe the air outside.
2585;AA012CA;You should rely on your own judgment when in a dogfight.
622;AM045AB;Sounds fair.
2481;AZ023PB;Get burned by the fire of hell and die!
1498;AM075BB;Easy for you to say!
1790;AEX04_556;Excellent! Execute the operation!
7461;AU011DD;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
399;AM079BB;Yeah.
999;AM017BE;We did it!
1186;AB008BC;Hey, let's run!
791;AN015DB;Let me help you.
7790;AU171CA;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1098;AE053BA;We're in combat!
1227;AC006DA;SENSOR IS RESPONDING!
2161;AR005ZA;The blame is on me. I'm sorry.
1870;AE002AB;YEAH!
1260;AE002_090;Maybe they were hiding somewhere.
2582;AA055BB;I'll buy you a nice meal if we come back alive.
4252;AE178_030;But we can't mass-produce it now! We'll only use it in major tasks!
3481;AA046W;Even in a place like this, I won't say anything discouraging.
1048;AL017DB;That's great!
2306;AT108CB;HEY! SAVE ME!
2021;AF026BC;How long before we can engage?
637;AM007DA;Don't give up.
1738;AA008BE;It's just fighting. Easy.
1335;AEX04_016;Also on the left!
1374;AZ032Q;Don't break it too easily.
652;AM051DD;No!
2038;AD003DA;The enemy is outside the shooting range!
1807;AA092BE;The enemy must be hiding somewhere!
3493;AEX02_015;I once saw a tower collapse in front of me, less than a kilometer away.
3420;AE114_008;I say what we lack in technology, we make up in bravery!
1818;AK005CB;Something's wrong! Enemies!
1516;AE190_017;THEY'RE CONTROLLING MONSTERS!
564;AY001DB;Thanks!
7656;AU161AA;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
752;AE016DD;Faster!
1160;AE159_005;Team three, roger.
1514;AM197BD;It just somehow happened.
1504;AK006DA;The scout has spotted the enemy!
7730;AU151DA;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
2179;AE143_027;Objects crashing from the sky confirmed!
2090;AT106BB;I can't get out! I can't!
572;AM024CB;Go ahead!
287;AY022BD;Heheh
1771;AT107CB;I'M STUCK HERE!
2934;AE114_033;You think you can come and go as you please?
3559;AE138_010;Titans are impregnable! Infantry, you can just stay behind us!
755;AM045BC;YES SIR!
2026;AN004BD;It's my duty to protect civilians!
480;AQ001BB;YEAH!
635;AM031X;Okay.
3355;AA108BD;I've always wanted to be a soldier, now my dream comes true.
877;AN024BE;Let's go together!
1492;AM177BE;Because all I know is fight.
1447;AK016BD;The job will never end.
3123;AE124_010;We're surrounded by the enemy! Send in support!
1269;AM102DA;Now's not the time!
1566;AE002_167;Open the blast door!
2687;AA010AB;EDF is the Guardian of Earth. We can't lose.
1923;AA060AB;Show them what heavy gunfire is!
1365;AR013AC;It'll be crowded in hell!
442;AG005AC;Coming!
1709;AZ034J;Civilian, you are brave.
1147;AZ012O;Targets confirmed.
1297;AC026DB;Countdown to the battle!
2070;AA055BA;I'll buy you a nice meal if we come back alive.
3170;AZ005QB;Carrier to air raiders, please indicate dropping coordinates of the vehicle.
570;AL018AC;Good job.
2486;AA078BA;I can't stand it anymore. I want to go home.
1371;AR001BD;CAPTAIN!!!
497;AM040CA;Correct!
1031;AQ002EA;AHHHHH
1192;AI001DB;The wings are abnormal!
1118;AP024BA;Did I take it down?!
2504;AA052DD;Don't judge me by my looks, I have a degree!
1558;AEX04_002;Start the operation now!
1868;AL026DA;The opponent got nothing on me!
1420;AK006BA;The Scout has spotted the enemy!
1346;AK004BE;The sensor shows something!
6890;AU032BD;We shall split our wings wide and fly high, Soaring, gliding through the endless sky!
1244;AM135BB;Yeah, you could say that.
917;AN008CB;We'll protect you!
1232;AZ031G;Mortar! Fire!
1804;AI013DA;The wings can't hold any longer!
432;AY002BA;Thank you.
1655;AL040BD;We've done our part, right?
1669;AM139DA;We can never let go of the enemy.
1057;AD010DC;Ready to take off!
1500;AF004ZA;The enemy hasn't spotted us.
830;AE004X;Go to hell!
1865;AE001_019;The lights will return to normal soon.
1331;AR036BA;Ken got SHOOT UP!
1345;AM101DC;Get your facts straight!
3146;AE169_012;We'll call the giant beta type King from now on.
1978;AE128_029;IT'S THE ALIENS!
868;AM008ZA;That's great!
6733;AU112DB;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
1327;AC002AC;The battle will begin soon!
1084;AB006DD;Prepare to fly!
1127;AN034BE;I know who you are!
3056;AE107_015;If you don't get tangled, there's nothing to fear. What?
1089;AE002_096;Master is incoming!
831;AM036CA;That's right!
1797;AA046BC;I was a cook before I enlisted.
7628;AU021BE;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise
597;AT302CA;Thank you.
680;AO001BC;LOANING!
2625;AZ033H;The enemy must have been blown to pieces!
1265;AE199_026;Something's wrong with it!
573;AM134DA;Thanks!
1494;AO003DA;Plasma power, charge!
886;AM082BC;I think so too.
852;AM053DB;Impossible!
2458;AEX04_607;This is Sniper, commencing operation.
4519;AE111_048;When the whole world turns into a battlefield, all we can do is fight!
9705;AE211_094;Everyone will die! You want to sacrifice the last remaining survivors for a bloody miracle? What's the point of saving our planet if there's no one left?
7608;AU131CB;Fight it down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
913;AY045DD;Good evening.
554;AL009ZA;Claire!
1000;AD001AA;Prepare to shoot!
1172;AE119_032;Go down to the shore!
3673;AE105_056;This is not just a world war, it is a space war!
1356;AM153BE;Oh, is that right?
5389;AE141_072;It's the first time we successfully destroyed a base. The data will be sent to the EDF headquarters.
1716;AE106_025;I really don't want to fight them.
1843;AN018AB;Never thought I'd be under your command.
1335;AL014DB;Exterminated!
3058;AA129BC;Only the powered exoskeletons can carry this heavy weapon.
2234;AT302AC;Did you destroy the net? Great job!
985;AD008DA;Entering the range!
2189;AA043V;Let's enjoy the cave exploration!
523;AM025ZA;Agreed.
1432;AN022DB;I will follow your instruction.
4428;AE112_048;This small-scale operation is going to be the turning point that will turn the tide.
881;AK001Z;We've got company!
2416;AEX04_618;This is Wing Diver, we've located target!
1633;AG008BB;The enemy has seen us!
1139;AG004AA;FIRE!
819;AM194BA;Because I like it.
1234;AO032BB;RELOAD BULLETS!
1254;AM011BB;Don't let it get to you!
762;AM050CA;Not quite!
905;AE003AC;Gah!
3244;AE211_080;Are you serious? You sure you want to do this?
1846;AH004BA;DON'T DIE! STAY ALIVE!
1259;AL009DD;YEAH!
2727;AEX04_376;Looks like a new monster species! Stay on alert!
2173;AE199_023;The entire city is their food source!
2395;AI003AB;Keep fighting, even if I don't make it.
1903;AZ001O;Bulge later, reloading complete.
2669;AA016DA;I think this equipment is best for fighting monsters.
2558;AE198_027;Bugger 4 here, took some nasty blows!
1819;AN027BE;So I'll take you as our acting captain.
4239;AE196_006;There are still survivors in this area. Exterminate those creatures right away!
3362;AA090DD;Wow, the military equipment is truly advanced!
740;AE210_134;Excellent!
653;AM056CB;Oh yeah?
1942;AR004AA;Damn it! You killed my guys!
1104;AP007DD;Hit Confirmed!
1391;AA044W;The pressure is killing me.
1076;AY055DA;I'm going to sleep."
1115;AL017V;Check your weapons!
1499;AE129_001;All teams, move forward.
1371;AL039BD;Can I get a medal?
1224;AT205BE;I'LL DESTROY THE WEB!
1031;AH006DC;Are the wings all good?
1026;AE010DD;Keep the speed!
766;AE002_045;I heard something.
812;AO002V;Reloading
2066;AE133_010;The aliens have made it this deep?
1740;AN005BB;I have no choice. I'll go with you.
3142;AA094DA;I was just a civilian pilot. My friends all joined the EDF.
1002;AE139_001;We're in this together.
1087;AJ001DB;Please send backup!
2794;AEX04_599;We've called for the rocket launchers. They will be here any second.
2631;AA086BD;I don't hate dark and narrow places.
1676;AK012DD;Is there no end to this?
3465;AA113BD;I heard about the worst situation. EDF has a commanding lead.
2486;AE119_011;Monsters were hiding out in the sand waiting for us
3108;AA124BB;They shouldn't have run into us! Tough luck for them!
417;AE105_066;Roger.
1213;AY031BC;That's a shame.
1441;AL025CB;You're quite good at flying!
1529;AI009DB;An error in the flight system?
2915;AA023W;My life was going as planned, but now it's a mess.
2079;AE198_077;Baga Bee Team, commence operation!
2177;AF011BB;Now is the time for a surprise attack!
1438;AN030DC;You are really famous.
747;AE103_039;Good job.
1982;AM120BA;You'd better be sure before you say anything.
3806;AE108_022;Sergeant, assign troops to protect the civilians. Take them to safety.
3264;AA027W;I don't like him, so I refuse to live with him.
1281;AE003_013;There are flying saucers!
1585;AE011BC;Die, you monster!
1230;AEX04_052;Enemy count, one.
2095;AEX04_228;I can't see anything through the fog!
7599;AE170_019;This kind of drone possesses overwhelming fighting ability. The entire infantry unit was almost annihilated by just a few of them.
3604;AE156_005;We can't fly around because of these webs!
1207;AEX04_321;Monster incoming!
1722;AJ007W;Sargent! You alright?!
1134;AM133BE;Yeah, maybe.
2434;AL002W;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1558;AM116BE;Don't say stupid things!
1779;AD018BB;Take them down when they get closer.
1108;AZ024J;Commencing airstrikes!
1359;AZ011J;Enter the air above the target.
1379;AM176BA;I can't stand them, that's it.
2501;AA045AA;There's enemies hiding around. Stay focused.
960;AF003AA;Let's move closer.
1251;AE004BD;FIRE!
3027;AA083DD;This operation… is the Commander serious?
2119;AZ009N;Lionic Missiles, Fire!
885;AF018AB;All finished reloading?
566;AM029ZA;Agreed.
1684;AA082BE;I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.
1061;AY004BC;I barely escaped.
4679;AE164_002;They failed to destroy the mothership in India, and our air force suffered a great loss.
885;AM054DB;I can't do that!
4697;AA144BE;Although I am familiar with the use of private-powered exoskeletons... Hmm...
1672;AR030BA;THE PRINCE GOT SHOOT UP!
2286;AZ004I;This is artillery, please designate targets.
846;AL021BB;Woo-hoo!
2200;AE004_029;Aliens have finally landed on Earth!
1022;AB007DD;Move, move!
682;AE009DD;THIS WAY!
1249;AD008AB;Too far, close in.
1140;AT204DB;And someone got stuck!
966;AY046DC;Let's fight together.
1942;AE018AB;We're the strongest! Fire!
1705;AE157_017;Operation over? Copy that.
1599;AT201AA;Save those tangled by the web!
1641;AE181_027;We'll take care of the monsters!
2624;AA022AB;Never lose your guard, even though there's no enemy around.
1298;AH010BC;The medic will check you later!
1947;AD018DB;Plasma Drive, release power!
1007;AD001W;The enemy's coming!
2011;AA059BC;Are you a soy sauce or ketchup person?
2177;AE183_007;I was almost eaten by one of them.
792;AU001Y;I'm trapped!
1342;AM122DD;Stop daydreaming!
3093;AE003_039;Keep the monsters AWAY from the powered exoskeletons!
1831;AE146_059;Just being alive is a miracle.
1276;AE174_031;Derois destroyed!
2169;AI003Z;I'll drag someone to hell with me.
790;AY027BA;You're funny.
2969;AA004BC;I am confident of my shooting. Just count on me.
5857;AE138_019;Only a flat and open plane can maximize the railgun's full capacity. They're doomed the moment they were lured here.
1672;AE025BC;That's what I'm waiting for!
2276;AA070BD;What do you add to your sunny side up eggs?
650;AM095BE;That's right!
2364;AA056BB;I'll treat you to a thickly cut steak.
1317;AM143BB;Can we change the subject?
6452;AE118_006;This is K6! Operation failed! Target escaped! I repeat, Operation failed! Target is on the run!
2422;AE146_041;Let's leave the building and fight against the enemies!
674;AA018AB;Reload now.
1248;AD002AA;Prepare to engage!
2441;AN032BA;I'm so happy that I can fight together with a hero!
1274;AK017BB;THIS IS HOPELESS!
616;AM017Y;Understood.
6908;AU162DC;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1252;AJ001Y;What'll happen to us?
756;AEX04_058;One more.
423;AM211BD;WHAT?!
2001;AE138_016;Hang in there until the new weapon arrives.
2601;AS001DD;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
3174;AZ006J;This is Bomber. Air Raider, I'm back. Are you okay?
1918;AE199_016;THE BUILDING IS COLLAPSING!
9110;AE167_019;Mission complete! Astonishing outcome! Among all of their landing locations, this is the only city that was defended successfully!
2532;AT001Z;SHIT! AHHHHHHHHH!
2855;AA014BB;We don't accept immigrants on this planet.
3516;AE149_017;Check out its legs! Those are giant cannons!
1551;AE002_125;Is this the monster's realm?
354;AM161DC;Huh?
2453;AZ037Q;This is specially made. It will surely be handy.
1580;AC011DC;Weapon system, unlock!
4266;AE143_050;It's only rumor among soldiers. There's no such thing as a secret weapon.
1238;AG009BD;INCOMING!
2525;AY041DD;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
2333;AE159_012;I have a bad feeling about this.
1361;AE107_007;We haven't seen those before!
1444;AF008Y;We should just keep hiding like this.
985;AK009BB;I heard there is the enemy!
1613;AE183_024;We won't last much longer!
1708;AR007BE;I will avenge our captain!
3916;AA104BB;I used to be a security guard. Somehow I became a soldier.
1662;AO010CB;Weapon system, cool down!
2251;AE179_027;Unlock the blast door to the other side.
1111;AE028BE;WATCH OUT BUDDY!
2236;AE119_024;This is Scout, Red Monster sighted!
7598;AE162_032;No. It's in Oculus's nature to avoid staying long in one place. Instead it prefers to move between multiple regions.
1308;AH027BD;I'll protect you, Captain!
3760;AE150_007;It's pitch black out here, we can't see anything. Be careful.
1756;AF008W;Now's the best time to assault!
1497;AC020DD;I'll show you my techniques!
2643;AE164_021;Those drones are coming out from the mothership!
1990;AEX04_305;Confirmed new drone type.
4178;AE143_007;Our reinforcements won't make it! Destroy the anchors with current forces!
2394;AE128_031;Looks like they plan to get through here no matter what!
830;AM081DB;You're wrong!
895;AY058BC;I'm sorry.
1502;AA024DA;Plasma Drive, Condition 1.
1471;AE142_014;Monsters coming from the ground!
1605;AE143_006;Attacking the anchors right now!
496;AB011DB;Whew!
1460;AE163_011;Team 3, go for support.
3101;AZ030I;Confirmed hit at the target site. The hit was accurate.
1118;AB008BB;Hey, let's run!
862;AY031BE;That's a shame.
574;AM030Z;NO
1219;AD003Y;They're about to get in range.
918;AR001BA;Captain!
2253;AE002_038;I never thought the base would be under attack.
1207;AL040BB;We've done our part, right?
4287;AE170_021;These killing machines will be called Imperial Drones from now on.
1327;AA089DB;Birds can't fly at night.
1611;AE131_009;I wonder what will happen.
1609;AE124_005;We won't make it this time!
983;AL023CB;Save the power!
955;AA033BC;Come back alive!
593;AM070BA;No way!
1807;AE112_054;Now we can say goodbye to the monsters!
1447;AM128BE;You've gotta be kidding me!
3545;AE210_041;The mothership is transforming itself!
2277;AEX04_284;CONFIRMED! WINGED FLYING AGGRESSOR!
1370;AEX04_434;CONFIRMED ERINAEA!
840;AY039DA;All yours.
3122;AN017BC;A commander is required for the mission. Thank you.
814;AM079DC;That's not true.
12598;AE143_058;As a matter of fact, the aliens have many weaknesses. Among those, sulfur dioxide and certain nitrogen oxides are most apparent. Once they are exposed to this environment, they'll die from suffocation.
2836;AA031BB;Our superior's operation plans are perfect.
1548;AA020CB;No one's afraid of heights?
1903;AJ007X;Sergeant answer me
1077;AY013DA;I love you!
1598;AJ001BA;We're all gonna die at this rate!
791;AB008AA;GET MOVING!
1288;AE182_003;Attack the big anchor!
1427;AE177_027;Heading for base 228.
389;AM051DB;NO!
2029;AE117_010;Why send us a newbie out of all people?
976;AE100_022;Do it again!
949;AR015DD;One fell!
1412;AK005AB;IT'S THE ENEMY'S REINFORCEMENT!
1763;AM061W;You read too many comic books.
2709;AA022AA;Never lose your guard even though there's no enemy around.
1261;AE004_047;THEY'RE FIRING AT US!
927;AA016AC;Focus on the mission.
650;AM074AB;Whoa!
850;AY014BD;I'm healed!
725;AY058DC;I'm sorry.
2230;AA056BC;I'll treat you to a thickly cut steak.
1781;AEX04_132;Initiating satellite attack.
1534;AA046BE;I was a cook before I enlisted.
3646;AE113_039;So, if we destroy that thing, the aliens will be doomed.
369;AE138_063;What?!
1165;AA059AC;What a huge cave.
1778;AF009BD;Captain, let's attack now!
686;AM024Y;Affirmative.
3056;AZ038Q;The request was from a civilian. This vehicle is classified.
942;AE186_019;Tanks going in!
462;AM032BB;Yes!
936;AY043DD;Good morning.
1908;AEX04_400;There's a red one among those monsters!
2415;AE119_053;We're okay. We can manage it somehow.
2570;AF004CB;Move forward carefully. Don't get caught.
1559;AJ012BD;Where's the new commander?
1939;AI017BB;No! I can't fight anymore!
8415;AE197_031;The primers have been influencing humanity for so long. Maybe we are creatures created by primers, just like those monsters we are fighting.
1329;AM087BD;I knew this was the case.
879;AY018BE;Should be clear!
1180;AM086BC;So that's how it is.
1732;AEX04_710;Dispatching powered exoskeletons.
1306;AL024CB;Return to cruise mode!
980;AI004AB;Prepare for the worst!
25737;AEX02_041;The war against aliens continues, while the economy is on the brink of collapse. Many industries are forced to shut down due to harsh operational environment. We have to prepare ourselves for the largest economic setback in human history. The employment situation is getting worse, although the government has promised that better days will be ahead in the face of war. This will become a hard situation to resolve.
1727;AK003DD;Let's check the enemy from above!
1829;AEX04_340;Imperial Drones incoming!
2404;AZ021PA;The circuit burned out! Repair it now!
1375;AM125BB;You're absolutely wrong!
2529;AA013AA;EDF is human's hope. Remember that.
2735;AE210_026;IT'S GONNA BLOW! FALL BACK!
1133;AH007DC;Check if there's any damage!
1021;AE105_038;THERE ARE TOO MANY!
1002;AI012BA;So unlucky!
694;AO014DC;Landing
1523;AE124_009;We can't possibly win!
1378;AE140_018;Not much ammo left now.
3622;AE137_024;If we can wipe out all enemy ships, that should impact the aliens!
1601;AI010DA;Ugh! My wounds!
524;AM016CB;Okay.
1967;AEX04_266;Confirmed. Species Beta.
3962;AA018W;I used to admire the heroes in the movies, but the reality is cruel.
1584;AK019BE;There seems to be more enemies!
952;AN012DA;I'll follow your order.
386;AM064CA;WHAT?!
1386;AEX04_628;Rendezvous with the Wingdivers!
546;AD024DD;Ready!
3524;AE114_023;Oh no! I just saw aliens! I can't believe they're real!
810;AY050DD;Goodbye!
2257;AY041BD;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
3675;AE117_001;This is Ranger 2. We will attack when the last member arrives.
551;AM108DA;No worries.
892;AY014DC;I recovered!
1331;AA027BA;I start to feel hungry.
1358;AO003CA;Plasma power, charge!
781;AM067AA;You did it!
985;AL023BB;Victory
1421;AY062DA;I shouldn't have done that.
1523;AE121_063;Drones are coming again!
1919;AE126_011;There are aliens guarding the pylons!
1111;AY060DC;I apologize.
1145;AB002X;RUNNING AGAIN?!
1421;AN031BC;It's my pleasure to meet you!
1407;AC007AB;Safety device disabled.
1683;AI004CA;Sorry, I'm just useless.
1576;AE020BD;FIRE YOUR WEAPON!
863;AE150_033;A blazer?
2261;AEX04_306;CONFIRMED! NEW MONSTER SPECIES!
2977;AE180_034;Barga's main system has normalized. Ready for combat!
2341;AL003DD;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1378;AE149_014;Something is coming down!
2266;AE005_001;Mysterious monster URGINOUS CONFIRMED!
4756;AE157_033;But they were completely annihilated eventually. We must prepare for the worst.
748;AM125DC;Thank you.
999;AM056DB;That won't work!
619;AM154DC;Oh yeah?
742;AN015DC;Let me help you.
537;AM066AB;Thank you!
3002;AA097DB;I think I'll stick with flying after leaving the military services.
1623;AM145BC;You read too many comic books.
535;AY050DA;Goodbye!
1644;AF001BD;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
1139;AM213BB;WHAT'S GOING ON?!
4131;AE129_028;If we don't destroy the teleportation ship, we won't be able to approach the base!
5143;AE141_004;We will foil their plan once they lose the stronghold on the ground. We must succeed no matter what.
268;AP007BE;Hip!
2176;AS003FC;AHHH! NOOOOOOO!
850;AP015BB;We got one!
1275;AH011BE;We'll fix you up later!
2162;AE167_017;Big Anchor successfully destroyed!
551;AM084BE;Agreed.
2470;AA012AC;Count on each other as brothers. Fight together!
1743;AL029DA;I must prepare for the next battle.
1099;AN019BC;Let me join your team.
1250;AE013W;ATTACK THE LEGS!
1358;AH023BE;THE CAPTAIN IS INJURED!
5648;AE113_040;Now that we've found the enemy's mothership, all we have to do is shoot it down. I like our chances.
526;AQ006BB;NUHUH
985;AEX04_055;Three remaining.
620;AM061AB;Thank you.
2514;AE185_012;The veil is not deep enough! They're climbing up!
1319;AE148_009;ENEMY ROBOTS!
473;AM031CB;NO!
617;AM057CB;Really?
2513;AZ031J;The bombing is over. Ground units, good luck.
1565;AE002_097;THERE'S A HOLE IN THE CEILING!
971;AB009CB;LET'S FLY!
1569;AE013Y;I can't! Please!
1342;AL011AA;Enemies are wiped out!
1471;AE205_024;IT'S WIGGIN' ALIENS!
1320;AG011BC;The enemy is here!
1797;AEX04_257;It's getting so cold at night.
471;AM058CB;What?!
1093;AO008BC;I'm out of ammo!
978;AM033CA;I won't grant it!
1400;AM125BC;You're absolutely wrong!
1086;AM006BC;I'll figure out something.
2561;AT102BB;I'm tangled in the threads and I can't move!
2790;AE002_061;There should be powered exoskeletons in the hangar!
3192;AE141_033;Powered exoskeletons, ready for close range attacks!
2133;AO013BE;I'm changing the magazine! Support me!
550;AE017DC;Higher!
5651;AE149_025;We suggest you equip small interceptor missiles that can bring down those fired from Deroys.
796;AM021DD;You did it!
2303;AW001V;Did you destroy the net? Great job!
790;AR016BA;One dead!
2480;AE141_088;Bastards are they trying to finish us off?
2545;AE004_085;Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
794;AE015BA;HOW'S THAT?!
1437;AL006DB;Yeah!
1943;AE191_016;Don't fall! Watch your steps!
1633;AE143_055;They can't handle air pollution.
3086;AA010Z;Don't fear death, make death fear you!
1953;AA026DD;Stabilizer, all normal.
3159;AE116_001;Not only the aliens, but the monsters are here too!
785;AM189BB;This is for money.
597;AP001BB;We hit it!
1763;AC020BE;Remember what I told you yesterday.
667;AY029DB;Hahaha!
2171;AA074DD;I've never been trained to fly underground.
608;AM009BA;Don't move!
2579;AE110_015;TRY DODGING THAT, DUMBASS!
1517;AM103BC;That's written in the books!
2947;AE003_026;This is Eota-3, commencing initiation procedure.
1009;AP006BD;We got one!
530;AY023DC;Hehehe
1099;AM141BC;You're so funny.
657;AEX04_131;Fire!
1729;AM067BC;Can't meet those expectations.
7728;AU151AA;Abandoned by my friends and family, Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
1073;AE191_023;I FOUND A DEVICE!
1720;AQ004ED;Noooooo!!!
594;AE004_027;BACK UP!
2410;AI016BE;Oh no! My eyes are blurry!
2448;AN004DB;You're a brave civilian. I'll protect you.
2573;AL004W;Elite
1894;AZ002QB;This is Carrier, arrived on scene.
1401;AN003ZA;Spriggan's will protect you.
1035;AI007BD;WHERE'S THE MEDIC?!
2566;AE164_017;Watch out for enemy bombardment! Clear the area!
2657;AA110BD;Being a soldier is awesome, you can get a pension!
836;AO004DC;Power Control!
1342;AD020BA;Crap! Too far!
6953;AE112_035;We've been fighting monsters for the past five months. We've reached our limit. If we don't win today, mankind will lose.
867;AM164BB;I appreciate it.
855;AG001DA;INCOMING!
1146;AE162_006;Ground units, move in!
1218;AI021BA;It's just a scratch!
3084;AZ025PA;The creator of this weapon must be a genius!
1211;AE007BC;DROP DEAD!
901;AM073W;Thank you, sir!
2519;AA005BB;It's gonna be another real battle today!
1734;AE018V;STAY CALM WHEN YOU ATTACK!
2194;AT306DA;You are my hero. Thank you.
6801;AE141_079;There are some inappropriate contents in your operation report. Reports will have to come to me first from now on.
3718;AE004_003;AFEs, move out. Infantry, move with the AFEs.
1703;AC008BC;We're almost in the enemy's range!
2619;AE002_126;We'll be safe when we reach the surface. Let's go!
2128;AE171_031;THAT'S THE MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ARCULUS!
1255;AT001BA;AHHH!!!
2152;AE010Z;OOOOHHHHHH!!!!
2749;AE111_044;Monsters? Monsters are running in the street!
1309;AL017BB;Go find other enemies!
3485;AE195_026;Everyone else was killed. I survived because I was hiding.
1193;AY008BA;I'm so grateful.
5006;AE198_080;I can't believe the A-Team got defeated this bad by those monsters! Proceed carefully!
1251;AM147DA;I want to be famous.
1981;AE154_014;All Mother Monsters have been eliminated!
2258;AR010AC;Drop those dead! Defeat the enemy!
1925;AF018BD;If you fire, they will see us.
1397;AA021AC;Still remember the training, right?
811;AE107_050;What is happening?
1757;AR002Y;Can you get up? Oh my.
1845;AE008W;This weapon is effective!
1321;AE107_026;THEY'RE DROPPING MONSTERS!
3620;AZ005G;DE-202 in the air. Please designate targets.
924;AE117_015;Monsters
6562;AU162BE;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
2312;AS014BC;I DON'T WANT TO DIE!
2465;AE176_072;Get a huge crane and smash it!
1557;AEX04_697;Tanks! Engage the enemy!
2129;AEX04_278;CONFIRMED, IMPERIAL DRONE
978;AA044DB;Are you mentally prepared?
1031;AM080AA;Oh my gosh!
1206;AM131BD;Don't say it now!
4395;AE146_050;This is Spencer! We have two survivors! Come quick! Anyone!
411;AM016BD;Great!
21967;AE109_030;I understand how you feel. Some may find it unbelievable while others may think I'm mad. I wish that was the case but unfortunately it's all real. This is an official statement. We have made contact with an extraterrestrial civilization and the Earth is being invaded by it.
1035;AE127_022;BEHIND YOU!
1778;AE202_039;Sentinel-2, please respond!
1821;AEX01_002;Is it the elite wingdiver unit?
1991;AEX04_391;Monsters are coming out from their nest!
1490;AL008AC;E-D-F!
1406;AE153_027;Cover the engaging units.
1570;AE175_019;Queens, two left.
2452;AEX01_005;Spriggan here. We are engaging hostiles.
1716;AW001Y;Thank you! You saved my life!
2197;AM009DB;Endure the pain! Let's keep fighting!
1449;AE113_017;There's a few monsters remaining.
566;AM056X;NO!
7737;AU121BB;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
2267;AEX04_227;A fog? At a time like this?
1958;AEX04_453;It's a mutated species, gamma!
1099;AN016BE;I'll help you do the mission!
1614;AE145_048;So they're not robots?!
1954;AZ009PB;Tell me the enemy's coordinates.
1145;AK001BE;CONFIRMED! THE ENEMY!
780;AY042BC;Nice meeting you.
1067;AE002_170;There are way too many!
2639;AD005DD;Confirmed distance, outside the range.
707;AE178_042;Yes, sir!
2459;AE070BA;Look closer! We are EDF!
4143;AE211_012;In the mythologies, God descended from the egg-shaped ship.
1316;AE210_123;The shield is down!
1324;AM010ZA;Amazing skills!
4805;AE106_022;There is no time to waste now. Sergeant, support the Dolphin Team and the Rabbit Team right away.
3085;AEX04_214;The enemy should be letting their guards down during this rain.
1585;AK002BB;The enemy has been confirmed!
11322;AE211_062;The primers have preserved their culture and civilization for a very long time. However, they relied not on technology advancement, but by evolving their species.
1238;AE008AB;FEET OF BULLETS!
1325;AG006DA;The enemy is attacking!
1288;AD013BD;It's too far to shoot!
2222;AE201_010;The winged aliens are invading the mountain!
6815;AU122CB;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
500;AQ001BE;Argh!
796;AM041CA;Yeah, sure!
3362;AZ018G;This is DE-202, target confirmed.
780;AE030BB;Leave it to me!
1548;AA004DA;I'll fly faster next time.
862;AL022BD;Hooray!
2753;AE119_028;There are so many of them! Looks like a red carpet!
594;AM134DC;Thanks!
7580;AU121BC;Now pick up our weapons, off we go. Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe.
3197;AE117_020;Unbelievable! There are aliens underground!
1151;AM110BA;That couldn't be true.
930;AB007DB;MOVE! MOVE!
2152;AEX04_348;CONFIRMED! WINGED FLYING AGGRESSOR!
2345;AE174_017;Deroi B confirmed. Stay alert.
994;AE179_058;ALIENS!
2002;AA024AA;Willpower is all that matters to a soldier.
1114;AM054DD;I can't do that!
2345;AF021BC;If you get too close, the enemy will notice you.
1806;AD007DC;Asking permission for flying combat!
882;AZ002M;Signal is received.
1600;AO006BC;Reloading! Back me up!
1462;AY030BD;That was close.
3393;AE141_002;Mind the artillery strike! Take cover behind the heavy tanks, infantry!
1531;AE068BA;You regret comin' to Earth?
3088;AE202_019;It seems like the aliens don't want to pollute Earth.
3403;AE186_018;Start phase two. Use heavy artillery to weaken the nest.
2735;AE145_076;IT'S TOO LATE! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
6816;AU172BD;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
817;AD005AC;Mark the target!
1993;AE135_018;Flying-type monsters confirmed!
1858;AEX04_440;FLYING TYPES INCOMING!
675;AG004DB;We're found!
3178;AQ004EC;AHHHHHHH!!!!!
702;AM070BC;No way!
881;AY066DA;My bad.
946;AA097BE;I wanna go home.
1214;AL025BE;It was the last one, right?
4225;AE116_002;If we are to attack the monsters, we have to get to a better position! Let's head to the ground!
2409;AA029Y;I'm prepared to die! Let's wipe them out!
2268;AD015BA;Pretty close, but still out of range.
3152;AZ016K;Attack to the target site is over. Good luck to the ground units.
3724;AT004DA;The web is... Request for backup!
942;AM123BC;That's not right!
7625;AU031BD;High up in the air our comrades fight, Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light.
1632;AM067BD;You can't meet those expectations.
828;AY056BA;I'm outta here.
1181;AQ010BA;The armor's broken!
1320;AE179_030;Enemies! Stay alert!
1493;AN033BB;Can I have your autograph later?
2305;AM009DC;And you're the pain. Let's keep fighting.
1114;AN011AA;My team will join you.
1087;AD002ZA;Wings stretched.
1612;AE166_012;All aliens eliminated!
2269;AF023BD;When the captain fires, we fire together.
3948;AA018Z;You can save your brothers if you win, so let's win!
1397;AA035Y;Why did you join the EDF?
880;AL013DA;Neutralized!
1081;AL013DB;Neutralized!
1838;AE170_004;These bastards are too strong!
535;AP004DD;Got it!
2809;AA031BD;Our superiors' operation plans are perfect.
1089;AM128DA;I'm really grateful.
337;AQ003BB;Ugh!
2486;AM195BB;That's the answer I get after seeking what I want.
1472;AE002_106;Are they trying to melt us?
1332;AA072BD;How is this happening?
2835;AEX04_503;Glowing domes! There are shield bearers!
2044;AE004_018;Something is descending from the flying ship!
2232;AL001CB;AHHHHHHH!!!
1425;AG008BD;The enemy has seen us!
490;AM032BD;Yes!
1026;AM042V;Let me thank you.
1574;AA064AB;FENCERS ARE INVINCIBLE
906;AY003BB;Let me thank you.
510;AQ002X;WOAH!
1419;AA011DC;My body feels heavy today.
3152;AE114_026;We have a reported sighting of humanoid aliens.
1526;AE151_002;Are we the only survivors?
7720;AU111BD;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
2213;AN005BC;I have no choice. I'll go with you.
1770;AE211_093;It will buy us precious time.
6758;AU032AA;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
971;AM117BC;You mistook it.
1442;AE159_040;I wish I could fly too.
962;AD004V;Raise your weapon!
2597;AT111DD;I'M STUCK IN THE WEB! REQUEST FOR BACKUP!
2026;AN022AA;It's my honor to fight with a hero!
2023;AE056BE;I've seen tons of movies like this!
1455;AA003BE;My shooting skills are good!
710;AP010DA;Destroyed!
1988;AE191_015;DESTROY EVERY DEVICE WE SEE!
1697;AK006W;Enemy detected on sensor!
1725;AA030BE;Following the orders can't be wrong.
1739;AE107_039;We welcome you with open arms!
1268;AN008AB;This team will protect you.
1399;AM138BB;That's also possible.
11461;AE146_055;It'll take some time before the rescue team arrives. We have to turn the table around with what we've got now. Capable units, move out! The main alien force has already left the city, so now is our chance.
1292;AM103BE;That's written in the books!
1575;AM067BB;Can't meet those expectations.
1427;AL019DD;Enter the cool-down mode.
1106;AH003W;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
1790;AE019AC;SHOW THEM THE POWER OF EDF!
3523;AN004X;Just make sure you stay alive no matter what. Best of luck.
1166;AE177_030;Enemies coming at us!
1103;AM086DC;Did you take it wrong?
1522;AE042AC;We will defend humankind!
1317;AE159_020;TOO MANY OF THEM!
2708;AZ008I;This is artillery, please tell me the enemy's location!
1024;AE045BA;Attack your right!
2001;AF001DD;The enemy doesn't seem to notice us.
2348;AY013BA;Thank you. I love you.
1230;AEX04_158;Secure this position!
1416;AA077DA;You can't fly too high here.
1371;AD002CB;Ready for flying combat!
1032;AM021BC;We can't lose!
1078;AM144BA;Was it in your dreams?
1741;AE122_005;Attack the red-colored drones!
1166;AR003BB;Captain got chewed up!
3073;AZ042G;Air raiders, you don't see us, but we're right above.
1050;AB012DC;Why keep running?
878;AQ005DB;I got shot!
2674;AA031CA;It's really a rare opportunity to fly in a cave.
1571;AM078BD;Let's talk about it later!
5043;AA021BC;I applied to join logistics support missions. Maybe this is my last time on the front line.
1981;AL004CB;E.D.F.!
3074;AE002_164;No way! It's likely that there are monsters on the other side!
699;AG005AA;Coming!
815;AA003EA;SAVE ME!
1558;AA109BB;Being a soldier is my duty.
719;AE016DB;Faster
1121;AM017DB;Good job!
462;AD024DA;Ready!
1438;AF005Y;Is now a good time to attack?
10844;AE161_029;These monsters will be called Aggressors, Species Gamma from now on. The Species Gamma is a very tough opponent. Make sure to stay alert when encountering them.
1982;AM028BB;I'll treat you to a nice meal!
1685;AE121_003;So they plan to live on Earth!
1150;AD008CA;Switch to attack mode!
1031;AE002_049;Let's go for help!
2513;AEX04_543;Contact! Enemy coming from the east!
968;AY016BD;MISSION COMPLETE!
1795;AA021AA;Still remember the training, right?
1046;AE145_055;They're well-trained!
649;AP012DB;Great!
2015;AJ014BD;Who is our superior officer?
1156;AS001BB;AHHHHH!
2903;AL028DA;Of course! I'm blessed by the Goddess of Victory!
3285;AF012BC;Sweet, the enemy is surprisingly careless.
1032;AY017DC;Easy peasy.
946;AE040BC;HAVING FUN?
1987;AM003CA;Keep flying until we beat down the enemy!
1634;AE177_034;We don't need your protection!
1520;AF006BB;The enemy is off guard.
1478;AM090DB;I won't forget this!
1536;AE128_011;Tiger understood
2783;AE141_073;Your remarkable deeds will not be forgotten.
1557;AL029DB;I must prepare for the next battle.
1711;AZ031Q;Hopefully, it'll be useful in battle.
1174;AA022CB;Did you enjoy flying?
683;AY026BB;Haha!
1221;AM188BB;This is for love.
1985;AEX04_411;There's a little monster, hiding among them!
1303;AR003BC;Captain Guts, shoot up!
2913;AE112_003;Ha! You look like you mean business!
1165;AT108AC;SOMEONE BREAK THE WEB!
1163;AK004X;They're ENEMIES!
1029;AM064X;Are you kidding me?
2143;AL015AB;We did it! Let's go for the next enemy!
354;AP007BD;Bitch!
1462;AM198BB;I didn't really think it through.
3558;AE211_028;For an organism, the enemy has evolved to a frightening stage.
1162;AM137DD;I've got no choice.
1751;AM150DD;Do you need any reasons to fly?
800;AM013BB;You're great!
869;AR015DB;One fell!
875;AE158_012;I passed it!
2497;AC021BD;Stay calm! I have to stay calm!
1193;AE105_032;It's no time for jokes!
618;AT301CA;Thank you.
2187;AR008BB;I can't believe the captain's chewed up!
7589;AU141AB;Farewell, my comrades, the time has come. It's over now, my love, and my familiar are all gone.
435;AE210_033;WHAT?!
992;AO005BE;Reloading ammo
7085;AE135_030;One of our soldiers single-handedly destroyed a vast number of flying types. The amount is fascinating.
1317;AM089DA;Do you have a screw loose?
1009;AM107BE;That's not true!
1310;AN018BB;Please let me join your team!
1721;AF031BA;The tension gives me the thrills.
1585;AD022DA;CONFIRMED DISTANCE WITH THE ENEMY!
1846;AE126_012;Aliens are guarding the pylons!
1346;AE180_003;CAN WE CATCH A BREAK?!
1063;AF018AC;I'll finish reloading.
1105;AM085W;Is that how it is?
790;AR002DD;CAPTAIN!
8660;AE181_032;The result shows that Barga is an indispensable asset. We will start repairing the other ten scrap bargas and use them as weapons against Arcalus.
7688;AU151DC;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
1215;AE018Z;NOW! SHOOTS!
1377;AR030BE;THE PRINCE GOT CHEWED UP!
6425;AA098DA;I plan to go back being an airshow performer after my honorary discharge. I'm confident in doing an amazing show now.
1330;AEX04_122;Open fire right away!
823;AM074W;I'm grateful!
6987;AU012BC;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
1645;AP010BE;We did it! Direct hit!
1126;AM005DA;I'll protect you all!
2794;AE162_023;Why is it here? Was it attracted by those monsters?
2057;AE147_018;These guys are tough!
5968;AE001_010;And you have access to military radio systems too. Somebody must be putting a lot of trust in you.
1198;AC022DB;Now is the time!
596;AY044DC;Hello!
2495;AI001CA;If something happens to me, you should keep fighting!
3338;AE165_003;They're aggressors, species gamma. Be extra careful!
1328;AE004_064;It's a robot army!
1351;AT205DC;Our friend got stuck in the web!
1483;AE202_078;Here we go again.
1121;AY017BB;Easy peasy.
2102;AE111_038;Is the whole world like this now?
631;AM048BD;Understood.
6841;AE162_020;We have confirmed that the mysterious monster Arcalus, whose whereabouts was previously unknown, is around the combat area.
2810;AE158_014;This is the advanced troop, we've passed the barrier!
1648;AD007ZA;Attack the incoming enemy!
1465;AE186_041;The queen looks mad as hell!
2254;AA112BD;Looks like the war situation is in our favor.
4865;AEX04_307;It's a mutated monster. It's got very high combat strength. Be careful.
3692;AE130_035;The enemy base is unharmed. Subsequent attacks are meaningless.
1663;AA059DD;Why did you join the EDF?
640;AM029AB;OK.
1328;AM140BA;It'll definitely come true.
1487;AE178_007;Spriggan's will provide backup.
3415;AE128_018;We will provide cover! Sniper Team! We're counting on you!
2361;AO025BC;Reload! I'm so good at this!
922;AC005BB;Enemy spotted.
2358;AA087BC;I don't want to fight those things in a place like this.
2438;AE130_011;Come here, quick! To the back of the heavy tank!
2874;AA120BB;Being a soldier isn't a special job anymore nowadays.
12817;AE104_027;Here is a follow-up report on the flying objects. They seem to be dropping monsters in various different places. The flying objects are extremely dangerous, so we urge you to keep a safe distance if you come across one.
1919;AD018DA;Plasma Drive, release power!
1090;AA058DA;Why did you enlist?
1528;AR018BB;An ally got chewed up!
669;AE009BE;Gotcha!
780;AY015BA;I'm back!
2939;AA012V;Don't be afraid of them! They should be afraid of you!
2392;AE155_019;It's dangerous, but we have to get close to them!
1348;AL038DA;Hahahaha!
2460;AE114_050;Aliens have finally landed on Earth!
1482;AF007CB;Take aim at the enemies now.
2232;AE131_042;Sergeant, join up with the vanguard.
877;AH018BB;Are you attacked?
2949;AT109DA;This is Wingdiver! Request for support!
803;AM004BA;I'LL HELP YOU!
1302;AE141_016;SHOOT THOSE ALIENS!
2428;AEX03_008;I'M CAUGHT BY THREADS! HELP ME!
2215;AE163_052;Again! And so many!
7731;AU111V;Now we will invade the underground, Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one!
2910;AL037DC;I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
361;AM027AB;Fine.
684;AM106BE;WRONG
1056;AY056DD;I'm outta here!
1371;AE007V;FEED THE BULLETS!
596;AM022CB;Okay!
2132;AA049DB;I used to be the best pilot in the world.
6111;AE202_060;Shelter D has also been destroyed. We're running low on supplies. It's going to be an uphill battle.
4550;AE198_006;Barga Team, form a barrier. All other units, support Barga and attack inbound hostiles.
746;AM067CA;Oh my gosh!
1747;AE147_017;Destroy the new type drones!
2781;AE118_037;Dover Leader. The enemy is tough. Be careful.
2094;AM112DC;Can we talk about things more interesting?
1975;AE105_018;Fire! Shoot them down!
2701;AF028BC;Since they didn't see us, should we retreat now?
2657;AF013BA;They didn't even notice us. We're winning!
1148;AL016W;We all did well!
1425;AM147DB;I want to be famous.
3264;AE210_023;The giant cannons aren't protected by the golden armour.
1004;AE139_005;It's not your fault.
3130;AE171_027;All units, carry out the mission faster! Arcalis is coming!
1715;AF024BC;Still no signal to attack?
2416;AA055BE;I'll buy you a nice meal if you come back alive!
1367;AE003_022;Incoming monsters!
3909;AZ014N;As long as this base exists, aliens can't live on this planet.
1103;AM162DB;I can't believe it!
1630;AK009DA;There seems to be something nearby.
2285;AE153_006;Ugh! Next two! Getting hit!
308;AM029BB;Got it!
2816;AE128_013;The fencers and tanks will stop the enemy from going onward.
1546;AD006BA;Attack them once they're in range!
1085;AN015BE;All yours, Captain!
6797;AU032BC;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
479;AM160DA;WHAT?!
505;AM172BA;Thanks!
1421;AB007DC;MOVE! MOVE!
1161;AO007BB;Change the magazine!
1890;AE105_052;Fall back! Fall back!
1704;AA049AC;Use the radar and not your eyes!
6556;AU142BE;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1090;AA058DB;Why did you enlist?
1081;AS005BC;HOLY-
2734;AE116_009;Maybe the monsters don't attack those who are larger than them?
1421;AM197BA;It just somehow happened.
1908;AD013DB;Still outside the effective range!
1199;AN015BD;All yours, Captain!
1427;AM166BA;Anything you want, my treat.
2302;AE205_009;I repeat, call back the rescue team!
3065;AE002_120;This is an emergency! You have to join the fight too, civilian!
1268;AE149_005;Why did they stop moving?
548;AH003DB;Hold on!
780;AH018BC;ARE YOU ATTACKED?!
995;AF001ZA;Act carefully.
3291;AA118BA;I became a soldier only for the pension, I regret it now.
1155;AH027BB;I'll protect you, Captain!
1202;AE114_069;Fall back! Fall back!
2598;AE164_005;The enemy has deployed shield bearers under the mothership.
810;AY074DA;You're good enough.
2219;AA010Y;I plan to go on a trip. Should I cancel it?
1601;AE005_032;EMC! Fire!
1349;AK004BC;The sensor shows something!
1594;AE135_022;Rendezvous with Ranger 3.
1722;AE059BD;WHAAAAAAAAAAA
877;AY063BC;Forgive me.
1313;AO005AC;Swap new magazines!
868;AM010Z;Keep that up!
1774;AL008BA;All are blown away!
1611;AA052BC;Getting used to pulling the trigger?
742;AM052DC;No way!
7734;AU151Y;Abandoned by my friends and family, Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
740;AM038DB;Understood.
1533;AM176BE;I can't stand them, that's it.
1319;AQ005ED;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
2132;AEX04_531;We've got a teleportation device!
1075;AY030BB;That was close.
1667;AE170_015;What a heavy downpour!
1995;AF015DB;Do not fire before the captain gives the order.
714;AH003V;Take cover!
1542;AA066BB;Do you have any reasons to fight?
2201;AE160_020;Shield Bearer's response disappeared.
750;AM039BD;Leave it to me.
1355;AE119_029;THEY'RE COMING FROM BEHIND!
1313;AE148_021;FIREBALLS!
603;AH001CB;Dodge!
1153;AF014BE;I'll warm up first.
7656;AU161V;This city has nothing but despair. All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared.
952;AZ013O;Target captured.
1503;AZ016G;Smoke signals confirmed.
2002;AT003DA;I got stuck by the web!
493;AB001DD;Go!
1479;AE186_028;The nest is tilting!
729;AM078DA;I got that!
3782;AE211_065;It's impossible. It's not fair!
929;AQ006DD;I'm dropping!
482;AE001_026;This way.
1608;AE176_029;Eliminate all remaining enemies.
825;AC027DA;Party time!
625;AM046DB;Sorry.
869;AT101DA;AHHH!
2135;AE119_002;Don't tell us we have to cook it ourselves.
1898;AS014BA;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1875;AN002DD;Looks like I can't leave him alone.
784;AM065CB;What the?
2910;AE114_005;That's a ship? It's as big as a city!
1366;AT206DA;Save our partners!
1381;AT205BD;I'LL DESTROY THE WEB!
2691;AN006AB;It's also our job to protect brave civilians.
902;AO004DB;Power Control!
1224;AS001BD;AHHH!
1481;AE004_053;One alien remaining!
3644;AE133_045;The nearby area should also have been relieved from the threat of the monsters.
2472;AT303BC;You destroyed the web? I'm impressed!
1624;AC015BB;Looks like the fight'll be violent.
1042;AM077W;I never thought about it!
442;AQ007BD;TRAP
1295;AE210_059;Attack the command ship!
2257;AE175_004;We must stop them from nesting. Destroy them!
4022;AE121_054;This is G4! Confirm that the giant cannons have been initiated!
1751;AE210_031;Mothership One is on the move.
22881;AEX02_038;Government Announcement Many civilians have become Minutemen to join the fight against aliens. The government has hence decided to grant the Minutemen a special privilege. From here on out, every militia will share the same benefits of that of regular EDF soldiers. But with privileges come new responsibilities. For details, please refer to the PR department.
1939;AE205_021;The monster army is approaching!
977;AS002EB;AHHHHH!
1284;AS005AB;TAKE DOWN THIS ONE!
1206;AE210_009;Drones incoming!
1768;AEX04_154;Missile has hit the target!
1688;AF004BD;Looks like the enemy can't see us!
4070;AE128_044;We've requested air support, but only a few of them can get here right away.
807;AH020BA;We're hit!
1778;AM081W;Because I wanna be somebody.
1540;AE128_066;Is raising monsters their purpose?
955;AM052X;It's not like that.
1821;AO013BD;I'm changing the magazine, support me!
1167;AG009BC;INCOMING!
1253;AY076DD;We're partners, right?
1394;AM055BC;The answer is yes!
1114;AE100_026;Concentrate!
1059;AE140_024;Where are the Lost Boys?
1145;AC004Z;Launch spears!
1335;AE005_027;It's really mad!
7758;AU141DC;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
2157;AE105_014;THEY'RE TOO FAST, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY!
2016;AE201_014;Look up! They're coming from above!
1828;AE044AB;Humankind will fight to the end!
1498;AE012BB;Don't look down on me!
1015;AC012AA;Check on both sides!
1399;AEX04_105;Bombardment ceased.
1893;AD017DD;Come on, get into range!
3599;AR004DA;Oh no! The captain is... Contact the headquarters!
1276;AP005CB;TOOK ONE DOWN!
1370;AE203_019;Shot down!
700;AM124DA;You saved me.
2098;AL021DA;Plasma Drive, energy saving mode.
1999;AE016CB;WE DAMNINATE THE SKY!
2046;AEX02_029;But it doesn't offer any sort of protection.
1363;AA028DA;Aurora Steer, cut!
1548;AEX04_260;Let's enjoy the evening!
1200;AM042X;That's absolutely right.
2563;AE110_029;Large flying saucers are dropping monsters!
1325;AM215BB;WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
2389;AE137_015;Our opponents are confused. Keep on going.
1112;AJ017BD;COME HERE!
1149;AC001AA;Everyone stay alert!
4571;AE202_041;This is number 15, Sentinel-2, please respond. Please!
3023;AQ005EC;AHHHHHHH!
1841;AK018BE;Today is such a tiring day!
1767;AD015BE;Pretty close, but still out of range!
2557;AE179_037;The gigantic unloader is a mobile crane!
2122;AR008BD;I can't believe the captain is chewed up!
1394;AA008Z;Make death afraid!
1193;AL009BE;Wooaaaahhhhh!
1088;AM206BC;Is that how it is?
2169;AL036DA;We won! I can't believe it!
1578;AF003BD;I think we can approach them now.
1739;AE197_002;I SPOT A FALLING OBJECT!
1121;AP024BD;Did I take it down?
1906;AE111_013;Kill us all, that's for sure!
2325;AE197_025;This isn't the first time the primers are here.
1031;AM064W;That sounds alright!
7488;AU011DB;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
686;AK011DD;AGAIN?!
570;AM048V;WHAT?!
1909;AE107_027;Damn, defeat all monsters!
1808;AE150_039;Attack the mysterious monster!
2232;AF031BB;The tension gives me the thrills.
1274;AT103CA;THIS IS THE ENEMY'S TRAP!
655;AE127_001;They're coming!
3196;AE125_023;Don't stop attacking! Avoid the artillery fire!
2179;AE119_049;Don't give up! Fight to the end!
1852;AE141_024;Squad 2, disperse to the left.
3515;AA033V;I love this planet more than those things do.
4186;AE004_031;Permission to engage with aliens granted. Ground units, engage the aliens.
1171;AP008AB;Hit next!
1961;AA057AA;Always check on your partner's positions.
1122;AEX04_166;Secure this mountain!
1109;AS003BE;NOOOOO!
1904;AH026BD;Captain, I won't let you die!
1210;AE179_011;This way! Hurry up!
1053;AEX04_069;Target destroyed.
1881;AE069BD;DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HUMANS!
2154;AE126_010;Aliens seem to be guarding the pylons!
1276;AE176_047;Next one. Okay.
1464;AE001_037;Die, ya monster!
790;AP022BC;H-HIT!
1826;AR003DD;Captain! Please respond!
2175;AA002ZA;Fly like an Andean condor!
7607;AU121X;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
1425;AEX04_721;BAGA HAS ARRIVED!
4378;AE211_073;I can't believe this. Are you saying that thing has unlimited power?
5813;AE131_038;If they can only nest in natural caves, that means they don't have a strong ability to reproduce.
372;AQ005AB;Gah!
913;AEX04_192;Defend the tank!
1876;AN013AC;Here you are. Leave it to you, then.
848;AN012AC;We'll fight with you.
1595;AL015DA;We took down the last one!
621;AH002DB;Dodge!
1210;AL012BA;Mission Cleared!
878;AM032AC;I can't approve.
1009;AA018Y;When can I take leave?
1524;AEX04_037;Five more aliens out there!
1879;AA076DA;I can't believe we have to fly in the dark!
1691;AO010DD;Weapon system, cool down!
2897;AE118_010;Don't tell me it will pass through! It's already here!
3772;AE138_060;If the aliens hadn't come, would these weapons be used on human beings?
1429;AE198_043;YEAH!
1513;AE019DB;Die from my dance!
1604;AH004BD;Don't die! Stay alive!
1576;AEX04_449;It's a species gamma!
1620;AR029BD;The boss got chewed up!
8246;AEX04_310;Looks like an advanced teleportation ship. Its weak spots have been reinforced, but it can be taken down with sustained fire. Keep attacking.
2278;AR012AB;Don't bother the dead! Save those alive!
1155;AA001BA;Show them our strength!
2018;AE127_026;MORE CUNNING, FROM THE SIDES!
2297;AR008BC;I can't believe the captain is chewed up!
1367;AL023BE;VICTORY!
1104;AA079BA;Don't get left behind.
1390;AA052BB;Getting used to pulling the trigger?
727;AM158DC;What's this?
1165;AM094BD;You don't need to point it out.
857;AE053BB;We're in combat!
1053;AE031BE;I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT!
2454;AEX04_445;Flying types approaching! Prepare to engage!
539;AD003BA;INCOMING
2237;AL027DB;Is that all you've got? Too weak.
7625;AU131Y;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1430;AD005X;Looks like a bit too far.
2203;AE150_012;I guess every species is gathered here.
2348;AA029BC;Leave in the Headquarters and we will win!
2149;AL012AA;Confirm if we've exterminated them all!
1618;AEX03_013;MONSTERS COMING!
1303;AA030AB;You will win, correct?
1968;AE210_106;Storm One is still fighting!
1533;AT206DC;Save our partners!
837;AM045Y;I thought so!
7597;AU161DC;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now Cause not a soul was spared
1031;AM042DA;That's not gonna work.
441;AY054BA;Goodnight!
924;AD011DC;Move closer.
1885;AU003ZA;Step back! You'll get killed!
880;AM033W;Not possible.
2959;AE003_043;Give me a sick wrap! Where is the second lieutenant?
1827;AE123_015;ALIEN SHIPS ARE COMING!
805;AM015AA;That's it!
1944;AT108BA;Caught in the web! Rescue me!
1440;AM111BE;It only seems like that.
1047;AF009CB;This is exciting!
4999;AE186_016;Let the powered exoskeletons handle the flying type. The rest, concentrate your fire on the nest.
3709;AE133_020;We think those giant monsters are running this nest. Exterminate them all!
743;AM015DC;Well done!
2543;AI001CB;If something happens to me, you should keep fighting!
1753;AN023BC;You're lucky. I'll help you.
1909;AO009CB;Transfer Drive's Power to Weapons!
1084;AM092DA;Better keep it to yourself.
2910;AE119_040;Their shells are too thick! We can't shoot them dead!
2374;AN027BC;So I'll take you as our acting captain.
1091;AE002Y;YEAH!
2275;AE158_029;Annihilate all shield bearers!
988;AP007AC;I took one down!
2585;AA012BB;Actual fighting is much more fun than training.
1819;AEX01_004;Spriggan unit here, we're moving in!
2260;AK003AC;This answer is responding! Stay on guard!
1140;AE011DC;Can you keep up with me?
2063;AL010BC;EDF! EDF!
2700;AEX04_684;This is Tag Team, moving in!
1532;AL001AA;AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
1183;AS008BC;HELP ME!
3642;AE210_081;IT'S TOO LATE! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
2467;AN013AB;Here you are. Leave it to you then.
847;AY022DB;Hahaha
867;AE019BE;Hey, now!
1197;AT108CA;Hey! Save me!
1609;AE186_038;The queen is here. Attack it!
2323;AEX04_149;Requested missile attack. Missile incoming.
950;AA044BD;Do you need support?
1889;AE163_017;ARE THEY CALLING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?!
6598;AU032W;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
876;AC019BA;Can't stop shakin'?
2195;AE211_078;Initiate Operation Omega.
1106;AA061DC;Why would you become a pilot?
1724;AQ008CB;AHH!
957;AM050AB;I can assure that!
3021;AE142_012;If they can move underground, they should still be around!
1610;AZ011Q;I've confirmed dropping coordinates.
2101;AE124_006;WE'RE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED!
33188;AE210_018;We fight for our land, family, and friends. Unfortunately, we are losing everything we hold dear. We have all been wounded, and we're losing our courage to fight. What are we suffering for? I just need to place my hand on my chest and feel that hot and vibrant beat to know the answer. Everyone else is dead, and we are alive. We, the living, have to fight. We will fight in the name of our planet and stick it to them!
1841;AEX04_019;Enemy coming from the front and rear!
3249;AI003BA;It's no good if the situation goes on like this!
1864;AE203_016;Aliens have been deployed
767;AM106DB;I know.
2235;AE166_029;Watch out for that super huge gun!
977;AE197_006;Is everyone okay?
1493;AD007BE;CONFIRM THE SHOOTING RANGE!
1927;AI017DC;But today is really not my day!
1681;AF001DC;The enemy doesn't seem to notice us.
1425;AI010DD;Ahh! My wounds!
698;AY002DA;Thank you!
1485;AM137BD;No one is complaining.
2955;AE183_031;Hah! It's you! I should have known.
956;AA056AC;Go get separated.
2189;AA047BC;I can make the best dishes in the world.
1005;AP016BD;Took one down!
1024;AE018DD;Look at me!
1018;AE211_081;What is this all about?
1141;AY007BE;I owe you a big one!
1911;AD017BE;Shoot them dead once they're in range!
7564;AU141BC;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my familia are all gone
1135;AC023DC;It will begin soon!
1688;AM177BC;Because all I know is fight.
3394;AA104BE;I used to be a security guard, somehow I became a soldier.
1336;AL017BA;Go find other enemies!
1407;AN014AC;We must work together to win.
1235;AM136BB;That's not so bad, right?
13739;AE176_070;Arcculus has an uncanny regeneration ability. That's why our artillery fire can't harm it. Therefore, we should attack Arcculus using things with equivalent weight to that monster, and thus crush it the moment they collide.
1790;AE143_021;The anchors are falling down!
1291;AK004BA;The center shows something!
1162;AM061DB;Yeah, probably.
1995;AA007Z;Trust the spear with your life!
872;AP008Z;Good kill!
2220;AE059BE;GWAThankyou For Watching The Wednesday
1512;AD011BB;They're almost in range!
3247;AE113_006;These are species alpha monsters. They're no match for us.
1564;AEX04_457;FLYING TIMES INCOMING!
2357;AE159_022;Are you kidding me? So many of them!
5684;AE149_035;We actually defeated a Deroi with such a small group of people. What an amazing feat!
1603;AS003CB;HEEEEEEEEEEELP!
1171;AM076BC;I would if I could!
1597;AA122BE;I can't wait to start the fight!
2297;AE201_008;Spotted. Large winged alien army.
872;AEX04_119;Target hit!
516;AQ013BB;I've been hit.
2079;AR043BB;Comrade, leave the rest to me!
1325;AE179_028;No enemy in sight!
749;AO001V;Reload
1383;AE179_025;Contact! Aliens!
1387;AA078DB;I don't hate caves.
1087;AB004BE;FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN!
1626;AA065AC;We've defeated all the enemies!
1424;AO004W;Swap new magazines!
2344;AA134BB;Show them the strength of heavy firepower!
2118;AT002BC;IT'S PULLING ME AWAY! SAVE ME!
1436;AL013BD;Exterminated!
1555;AT002DB;Wings are unable to stretch!
564;AQ006BA;Ugh!
1134;AI009BA;Support me!
2864;AA020X;Heard someone wanted to drop out, but was rejected.
1810;AR009BE;Oh my gosh! Captain!
764;AQ006CA;I'm falling!
3678;AE131_016;I know, but we will suffer heavy casualties too.
1562;AE109_028;Hey, did you hear that?
628;AM160BA;You saved me.
1401;AJ009BC;Let's stay here and fight!
592;AM056Y;You're wrong!
4969;AE118_042;I can't believe that our attacks didn't work. Its vital force is uncanny.
429;AM201BE;What?
1468;AM141BD;You are so funny.
1999;AM179BE;Because I can't keep myself out of this.
933;AM004DD;I'll back you up!
1538;AM193BE;I've always wanted to do so.
2249;AA101BD;Really hate to step on the battlefield.
1915;AE193_009;Destroy the teleportation device!
1351;AT105DD;I can't escape!
1322;AM051AB;That's absolutely right!
2446;AA078BB;I can't stand it anymore. I want to go home.
1202;AM109DC;Let's do it your way!
1682;AK012BA;I got a bad feeling about this!
820;AM076X;Thank you, sir!
2468;AK005BE;Emergency contact! The enemy shows up!
2565;AR003CB;I won't forget you! Leave the rest to me!
1716;AA060BC;This is not a game, you got that?
1496;AI009AC;Let's get this job done quickly!
279;AM041Z;WHAT?!
1039;AH006DA;Are the wings all good?
1406;AN010CA;Well then, I'll protect you.
947;AM088BB;That's the truth.
3502;AEX04_379;It's a mutated, mysterious monster. It looks even more powerful.
2641;AN007BC;A civilian, then I can't leave you alone.
2232;AN001DB;A civilian? I must protect him.
380;AM020AC;Great!
2153;AE176_055;This is Nyx-2, attacking Arceilis.
828;AG001X;They're coming!
3113;AT111DC;I'M STUCK IN THE WEB! REQUEST FOR BACKUP!
1877;AS006EE;NOOO!
1451;AR017BB;It looks like one man died!
2008;AF007W;Now's the best time to approach the enemy.
1661;AT106AB;Over here! Save me!
601;AM115BB;You're wrong.
660;AE100_013;That's right!
2175;AI019BA;Damn, it's painful!
1258;AE190_020;Sniper on the building!
948;AM130BA;JUST YOU WAIT!
3309;AE210_001;The mothership is protected by drones and teleportation ships.
1334;AE129_017;Drowns!
1611;AA086DA;I really can't take this!
1572;AN013DC;Hi Captain, nice to meet you.
391;AE007Y;HIT IT!
2158;AT106CB;Don't save me! It's a trap!
17686;AE157_030;While the shield bearers block our attacks, they allow aliens' attacks and buildings to pass through. This means they will determine whether the contacting objects are threatening. In other words, if they don't see us as threats, humans could be able to go through the barrier with a low speed.
1744;AM026BB;How long have you been practicing?
7562;AU121Y;Now pick up our weapons, off we go. Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe.
970;AE015BC;How's that?
881;AF003AB;Let's move closer.
6207;AE137_010;Must have gathered here for strategic reasons. If our operation succeeds, we might be able to thwart their plan.
1918;AEX04_438;A mutated Aranea!
932;AM073DB;Totally agree!
3157;AA144BA;Although I am familiar with the use of private-powered exoskeletons.
4945;AE106_001;This is Dolphin. We're hiding in buildings with our flying saucers all around us.
392;AM201BD;What?
2576;AE159_042;How come such a huge nest exists?
748;AM108BA;That's not right.
1489;AM064DD;Oh, that's right.
2376;AN001V;Civilian, don't worry. You have us.
3112;AE146_024;It wasn't the rescue team. The survivor took care of them.
3611;AA011AA;EDF doesn't leave men behind. Ever. You got that?
811;AM036W;NEXT TIME!
3101;AE151_004;Easy peasy, we can handle those ourselves.
2659;AN036BB;You must be the ace. Nice to meet you.
2410;AE163_045;Talking about aerial combat, we're second to none!
1299;AE047BE;I see our chance!
2130;AA063DD;Why would people like you?
901;AA002V;STAY ALERT!
1121;AT003CA;IT'S PULLING ME OVER!
3078;AE210_015;Stop one! You can do it.
1865;AE016AB;Keep shooting until all enemies are down!
1258;AH009AB;You'll make it, don't worry.
2528;AQ008CA;AAAAAAAAAA-
764;AM068DB;Of course.
2639;AA012W;I'll climb to a position higher than the sergeant.
3082;AE164_025;The mothership is deploying drones! Type 2 drones!
896;AM135DC;Thanks for the help!
747;AM020BD;Good job.
1174;AN012DD;I'll follow your order.
347;AQ001FD;AH!
1120;AE004_013;Is it trying to flee?
1614;AL032BD;We took out the last one!
2339;AE002AA;RAWR!
2230;AE056BB;I've seen tons of movies like this!
7540;AU121BE;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
6365;AE204_010;If we let those monsters roam freely, all survivors will be killed! We have to stop this disaster from happening!
4900;AE157_023;The alien units are approaching the city. It seems that shield bearers are coming with them.
522;AM075X;Thank you.
1768;AEX04_699;Railgun team has arrived!
1888;AEX04_267;CONFIRMED. SPECIES GAMMA.
828;AT101BE;SAVE ME!
1743;AL010Z;Are these the entire enemy?
1331;AE124_015;Help
983;AM064DB;Ah, that's right.
1323;AM120DB;Let's change the subject!
2498;AA055AC;I will bring you back to the ground, no worries.
2052;AS013BC;Somebody help me!
561;AM017CA;Approved.
1259;AE141_058;IT'S USELESS!
1038;AL013DD;NEUTRALIZED!
954;AR003Y;One man down!
767;AM001AB;Keep it together.
430;AB005AC;RUN!
1065;AE176_051;It's Oculus!
1547;AS002BC;WAAAAAHHH!
958;AE027AB;Shot it dead!
1137;AR003BA;Captain got chewed up!
632;AY038BC;Greetings!
1889;AE135_029;All cleared. Well done.
1911;AE169_017;Successfully annihilated the king!
1105;AE104_049;Good, keep it up!
1275;AH023BB;The captain is injured!
982;AY028DC;That's funny.
1521;AC010DA;I will take down the enemies!
1651;AE021BA;THIS WEAPON IS EFFECTIVE!
1528;AR027BB;The newcomer got chewed up!
3043;AE144_038;Enemy robots landed in Russia, 200 in total.
1240;AH005AB;Be careful of the attacks!
708;AL005AC;We did it!
441;AM039ZA;Huh?
1027;AY062BE;I shouldn't have done that.
809;AP001AA;We hit it!
507;AM209BA;AHHH!
1512;AEX04_030;Also from the side!
1465;AL003AA;E.D.F.
1516;AE185_004;Attack! Stop them!
2401;AE202_077;If we could just find the egg-shaped ship.
2437;AN001BB;Are you a civilian? I'll protect you.
847;AE029AC;Shoot at the right!
2245;AE128_043;At this rate, they're gonna break through!
1267;AV002X;I'LL DESTROY THE WEB!
630;AE012DC;Lock on!
1087;AQ010BE;The armor's broken!
2614;AEX04_603;Sniper Team, get visual confirmation!
6743;AE198_049;Barga is only good against Urgenus, but helpless against the rest. Infantry! Cover Barga and take out the smaller monsters!
1979;AE137_025;FENCERS, JOIN THE STRIKE TEAM!
3707;AE002_144;No matter what happened, their situation can't be worse than ours.
2485;AK005BB;Emergency contact! The enemy shows up!
4210;AE186_010;This is a specialized anti-air unit! Watch me shoot down those flying-type!
6719;AU122BE;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
1544;AL003X;E-D-F!
8206;AE113_035;We thought about that, too, but we should have some time before the enemies start Plan B. All we can do now is try to weaken their combat strength.
660;AM045DB;I can't.
672;AM031Y;No way!
1927;AO007X;Crap! The magazine is empty!
1143;AM013CB;You're doing great!
2071;AE153_001;The battle has started. Let's move it.
1192;AY064BA;Well, I didn't mean to.
1274;AO016BA;WHERE ARE MY BULLETS?!
1305;AL026BB;You did great too!
1237;AG004V;INCOMING!
898;AP022BD;What the?
4034;AE003_021;Oh no! Aah! Help! Aah!
3061;AA024BE;I've got some juicy steak, I'll cook some tomorrow.
2470;AE002_010;We're getting out of here, straight to the surface!
1382;AF002DA;The enemy hasn't caught us.
2049;AE210_038;Number 11 has been heavily damaged.
660;AY056BC;I'm outta here.
1294;AS008BD;HELP ME!
1701;AT203DD;Someone is caught in the web!
1922;AA054DA;Beauty is a sin, indeed.
525;AM014DA;Great!
1366;AE110_004;Take out all monsters!
3465;AE004_074;What? Aliens with a different appearance compared to humans?
1398;AM198BD;I didn't really think it through.
3672;AE145_052;They're different from the aliens we've seen in the past! They're not humanoids!
626;AB008AB;Get movin'!
2826;AA011AC;EDF doesn't leave men behind, ever. You got that?
733;AH002Z;EVADE!
1859;AD018DC;Plasma Drive, release power!
4545;AE113_046;We think this is a good opportunity. We're planning an operation to attack the mothership.
2143;AE123_005;I love you guys. Now run!
6066;AE211_063;Does that mean the difference between us and the primers lies not only in terms of technology?
5246;AE112_012;There's only one successful case so far, and that was with the use of tactical nuclear weapons.
919;AY026BD;Ha ha!
1241;AR003BE;Captain got chewed up!
1022;AB005W;Run! Hurry!
1427;AA048BA;No one can beat me in poker!
1046;AE052BC;Attack the body!
1948;AE210_069;TAKING HEAVY CASUALTIES!
1160;AG010BA;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
4055;AE111_039;The end of the world is coming. I can't believe it's really happening.
787;AE009BB;Gotcha!
889;AM074DB;So I see!
1672;AE153_037;Next team, prepare for combat!
6775;AU032BB;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, Soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
7599;AU111DC;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
2053;AR004CB;You dared you kill my men!
1041;AP007AB;I took one down!
1263;AE160_008;Alien Spotted!
3546;AE118_028;The tanks just arrived. Infantry, fall back behind the tanks.
1890;AY065BD;I will never do that again.
644;AM040BD;Yes!
2121;AEX04_484;ALIENS WEARING SPACE SUITS ARE APPROACHING!
1238;AE129_036;Take down the aliens!
1928;AE002_035;Since we can't use the elevator...
2816;AA038AA;As they say, it's a winnable battle and we will win.
2395;AE181_002;The transport aircraft will be here momentarily.
484;AM044BB;Got it!
1510;AL018BC;It was the last one remaining.
2785;AQ009AB;AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! AHHHHHHHAAA!!
1586;AR011DA;One-winged diver is behind!
1363;AE160_021;Shield Bearer Destroyed!
917;AB005Y;I can keep going!
4767;AE175_003;The queens are making a move. It appears that all queens are flying together in one location.
896;AE029AB;SHOOT AT THE RIGHT!
1133;AO010AC;Cartridge change!
5976;AE107_038;You are already a good soldier. Just sign up and join us. The EDF could use someone like you.
1573;AE199_028;THE BUILDING IS COLLAPSING!
2395;AM178BE;Because I can't let them take over the Earth like that!
2126;AE125_009;So they're the Alien Artillery Unit!
823;AE142_001;IS IT TOO LATE?
1693;AA060BE;This is not a game. You got that?
1808;AEX04_665;Spriggan unit, we're counting on you.
503;AM031BB;Yes sir!
1923;AA011DD;My body feels heavy today.
4201;AA007W;This is an unexpected situation. We have to forget our guidelines.
830;AE132_014;This way! Hurry up!
1061;AF014BA;I'll warm up first.
1630;AH006AB;Look out for enemies counter-attack!
1538;AE203_003;Landing ship confirmed!
884;AA044BB;Do you need support?
1952;AN029DC;Is it really you?
908;AY070BC;Fine by me.
2675;AF012BE;Sweet, the enemy is surprisingly careless.
3594;AE198_032;Parker1 here! I'm severely damaged! Output decreasing!
1093;AL023BD;Victory
1523;AA051BD;I am the best singer.
2610;AD005DC;Confirm distance. Outside the range.
403;AM043AC;Yeah.
6680;AU132BA;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
1659;AR041BE;HOW DARE YOU SHOOT MY MEN!
1024;AL009V;Neutralized!
1557;AH014BE;I'll check out your wound later!
927;AM203BD;Is that so?
1398;AL004AB;Hurraaa!
667;AP007BB;HIT!
1398;AE140_003;I plan to do that too!
1620;AT003DD;I got stuck by the web!
7847;AU131BB;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1219;AT204CA;It's a trap! Be careful!
1714;AL041BD;We can call it a day, can't we?
1394;AM142BB;Can I call you teacher?
575;AH002BB;Dodge!
646;AM008CA;Good job!
2836;AI014DB;At this rate, I'm going to fall!
2080;AE138_059;They even developed this kind of weapon?
6600;AU162CA;Yet we still be fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1503;AY046DD;Let's fight together!
1134;AE006BD;WATCH THIS!
1194;AM071BE;THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
1241;AEX04_225;What a thick fog!
502;AM156DD;What?
689;AH001DA;Watch out!
1066;AA064BC;Why did you enlist?
1915;AE129_041;Aliens are calling monsters here!
802;AY070BE;Fine by me.
2846;AE194_021;Yeah, but we need Barga to destroy the mothership!
1724;AJ013BD;We can't fight without a commander!
2307;AA048V;Always check on your partner's positions.
1539;AE111_030;How long will it take?
2646;AE145_065;From behind, they're attacking from the rear!
1811;AE001_040;Aren't surviving dinosaurs, are they?
2418;AE002_017;IT'S BARBECUE TIME!
1895;AD001DD;The enemy is outside the range!
1564;AN004AC;Don't worry, I'll protect you.
1197;AE183_026;They're coming again!
1437;AA004FC;Help me!
2221;AA044AC;We must annihilate all enemies underground!
880;AM038W;Yeah, sure.
1269;AE211_033;Is it immortal?
401;AE002_048;Danger!
1094;AY016DA;Mission complete!
1266;AL015X;Let's chill out a bit!
1578;AM180BD;Because I have something to protect.
7441;AE202_085;We just need to find the egg-shaped ship. But where is it? Where is it?
2214;AEX04_680;Cougar 2, everything according to plan.
901;AM035BC;Sir, yes sir!
1115;AE177_041;Aliens are here!
3997;AE168_024;Aranea is the natural enemy of wing divers! What should we do?
1101;AF016CA;They'll see us if we shoot.
2577;AE103_033;Are you saying that we're not the only ones being attacked?
1321;AM021BB;WE CAN'T LOSE!
1293;AE103_012;ATTACK THE MONSTERS!
1550;AD005BC;Shoot them once they're in range!
2507;AN014DB;What a coincidence. I'm looking for a commander, too.
3072;AA115BD;I only did training! Now I'm doing the actual fight!
2648;AEX04_682;AFV is in position! Commencing operation!
1836;AA028BC;I want to eat barbecued meat now.
2263;AT105BA;I can't move! Somebody help me!
1100;AC002V;The battle will begin soon!
3663;AE005_053;That lava-like substance exploded the moment it was exposed to air!
1035;AV001Y;Someone's on the web!
478;AY002BE;Thank you!
1450;AM075BD;EASY FOR YOU TO SAY!
2093;AZ004QB;This is Carrier, the vehicle's on the go.
1493;AL015DB;We took down the last one!
3198;AE116_021;They should be on a leash! Have they no manners?
2017;AC019DC;See if you can handle the attack from the sky!
1238;AI015DD;I think I'm done!
1417;AR010BE;He was a great captain!
947;AM135BA;Yeah, you could say that.
574;AM012DC;Awesome!
1107;AM050AA;I can assure that!
3241;AE133_033;So, the monsters are breeding on Earth.
2471;AE141_049;This is Swallow 2! We're engaging the enemy!
1525;AQ005V;Aaaagh!
3873;AE114_073;From the sides.
4553;AA095DA;Once you fly in the sky, you hear people applauding. I really miss that.
980;AG008DA;They found us!
372;AQ006BD;OOF
2864;AE063BA;It's too strong! That's not what I was told!
1169;AY010DC;You are my hero.
898;AM080AC;Oh my gosh!
1015;AR031BA;Joe got chewed up!
979;AL037BC;That's enough!
1347;AO012DC;Cool Down starts now!
1653;AE060BA;So come, stay away!
1297;AC023DB;It will begin soon.
2406;AE103_009;Monsters! They appear around the pylon!
3330;AA144BC;Although I am familiar with the use of private-powered isoskeletons.
2641;AE128_012;This is Fencer! They won't breach this wall!
2139;AA125BA;Poor enemy! They have to fight us!
11401;AEX02_043;The government outlines relief measures to tackle unemployment. Each new EDF recruit will receive 20,000 US dollars and an extra 50,000 more after six months of service.
1116;AN011DA;We're joining your team.
675;AM022ZA;Negative.
566;AH002CB;Next!
294;AP001DA;Hit!
1065;AA059AB;What a huge cave!
1550;AK006BE;The scout has spotted the enemy!
388;AM043AB;Yeah.
1551;AEX04_328;CONFIRMED GREEN MUTANT
1950;AE003AA;AAAAAAHHHHH!!!
1104;AM213BE;What is going on?!
1074;AR035BA;Dan got shoot up!
940;AC011BA;I will survive.
2142;AF008CB;Don't shoot. On my command.
3063;AE174_005;Powered exoskeletons, destroy the enemy robots!
1794;AE117_051;They're calling monsters for aid!
1293;AT202DB;Someone is stuck in the web!
3600;AA024Y;I'm thinking about changing lanes. I trust you'll step up once I'm gone.
3899;AA126BC;We have weapons as good as tanks. Show them what we have!
1195;AY021DB;Ha ha ha ha ha!
1513;AEX03_007;Threads, dodge!
1557;AE159_010;Team One, prepare to engage!
1953;AS002DA;I'm bored.
7709;AU171DD;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1562;AE210_116;Onward, stop one!
623;AM209BD;AHHH!
824;AE013DC;No problem!
1850;AE141_026;Squad 4, dispersed to the right.
1762;AN003W;I got your back! Leave it to me!
749;AG009AB;We've been found?
3843;AE141_062;Ground Force! Commence attack! Get under the base and find out its weak spot!
878;AE202_065;Listen to me.
603;AY044DB;Hello.
2204;AN036BD;You must be the ace. Nice to meet you.
3172;AN015AB;The top priority of this team is to support you.
603;AY001BD;Thanks.
1442;AEX04_554;We've reached the combat area!
2105;AEX04_217;Damn it! It's freezing!
1241;AT003AA;YOU WANNA PULL ME OVER?!
1614;AE171_009;GX2, moving in.
2111;AE181_022;Looks like Bargo wasn't built for nothing.
3184;AA014Y;I'm a natural-born soldier. I don't hate going through drills.
4756;AE200_002;The anchors are being protected by shield bearers. Normal attacks won't be of any use.
676;AL016DC;We did it!
962;AO004AB;Magazine change!
339;AQ003EC;AH!
2709;AA073DD;So here we are, underground.
2126;AL050BA;Feels great to come back triumphantly.
815;AP020BE;YOU DESERVE IT!
1418;AE196_011;GET RID OF THOSE WEBS!
2190;AE185_008;The bridge won't hold! Fall back!
3178;AE155_023;The rage of the threads is long! Be careful!
1249;AN022BC;Nice meeting you!
1781;AA003DC;I can't bring shame to the elite unit!
1008;AE002_020;Monsters
412;AY053BA;See ya.
2481;AK005BA;Emergency contact! The enemy shows up!
1185;AE131_041;Where is the Vanguard?
1745;AE118_005;The monsters are nothing to be afraid of!
2474;AM006X;Don't worry, I won't leave my buddies behind!
1191;AA017V;Reload now!
1064;AD019DC;Switch to attack mode.
2970;AA020BA;I've managed to survive this long, how can I die now?
2363;AN006AA;It's also our job to protect brave civilians.
606;AQ004X;BWAH!
4485;AS001W;AAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
2732;AE178_037;You grim reapers aren't as good as I was told.
816;AM064AB;I'll pay you back.
512;AY043BA;Good morning.
1071;AB014BA;WHAT'S THE RUSH?
1480;AM090DA;I won't forget this.
2046;AE142_026;It's monsters moving underground!
1466;AN031BB;It's my pleasure to meet you.
1134;AM075BA;Easy for you to say!
1032;AM142BC;Can I call you teacher?
2255;AM079W;Because I have something to protect, that's all.
1556;AM067BA;Can't meet those expectations.
1703;AK010BA;Hey! We've got a job to do!
3499;AE191_006;We've discovered machinery, assumed to be deployed by the aliens.
3038;AN029BE;Is it really okay to let a guy like you to be our captain?
1661;AL040BA;We've done our part, right?
2470;AT003ZA;I got caught in the web! I can't escape!
424;AL009AC;Clear!
3292;AT307BA;EDF doesn't leave men behind, but I still want to thank you.
1406;AE128_017;They're coming this way too!
1117;AF006AB;The enemy can't catch us.
1011;AE013DD;No problem!
2288;AE034BE;Dare to eat me? Bring it on!
558;AE141_012;Attack!
14931;AE211_114;We have been living on Earth, isolated from the universe, knowing nothing about the powerful beings out there. What we are facing right now is the inevitable and infinite cycle of life.
3018;AA013BB;They must be surprised with the Earthlings' recklessness.
2063;AE130_031;Watch out for the enemy laser cannon!
560;AQ002V;FUUUUU-
1201;AM038V;THINK AGAIN!
1392;AT301BE;Thanks for saving me!
2662;AZ004L;Epimetheus surfaced, ready to attack!
1161;AM005ZA;Save the wings!
1619;AA086BA;I don't hate dark and narrow places.
740;AP010DC;Destroy!
1181;AR037BB;Ray got chewed up.
760;AB005DB;Get movin'!
2519;AE132_020;Be careful not to slip when you fight the monsters!
2095;AEX04_442;FLYING TYPES COMING FROM THE NEST!
3723;AEX04_090;Air raid was a success! Enemy forces neutralized! Take it from here!
1037;AA005FC;Stop it!
1739;AA018CB;Check the surroundings from above.
2203;AE035BB;I'll make you a side dish.
1969;AT004AB;It's pulling me in! Kill it!
2199;AZ026H;Rocket cannon! Fire!
994;AC009BA;I can't die!
1258;AEX04_051;Enemy count, two.
845;AY006BC;I'm in your debt.
3127;AI003V;I face death several times. This is nothing.
1785;AE210_084;Our attacks are useless!
1407;AK005ZA;Check the enemy from above!
713;AE003DD;AHHH!
959;AEX04_164;Secure that building!
1163;AJ001DD;Please send backup!
1135;AY005BB;I owe you my life.
1463;AEX04_420;NO! WE'RE NO MATCH!
3183;AE111_036;At this rate, mankind will soon be extinct.
1580;AE016CA;We dominate the sky!
1604;AM180BB;Because I have something to protect.
1944;AC006BB;I can fight. You can trust me.
6842;AU172BC;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end!
1604;AE117_004;You're too late, newbie! Hurry!
1186;AE120_010;Don't slow us down.
1392;AE171_026;What did you just say?
2665;AE004_072;Unlike the ones before, these aren't humanoids!
1765;AE198_002;All vehicles prepare to fire.
1798;AY057DD;When this is over, I'm out.
1542;AM199BE;I'll tell you in details later.
1114;AR033BB;HAL GOT CHEWED UP!
2507;AT305BE;I'm free! It's all thanks to you!
1132;AM051AC;That's absolutely right!
1889;AEX04_642;A fencer team is on site, join them!
1981;AE109_015;Our attack is ineffective!
2084;AE189_006;I can't move! Help me!
1394;AK004DC;Enemy reaction detected!
2834;AF030BD;Not yet. Not yet. Not yet!
3079;AA100BD;I'm unlucky. I will certainly…
740;AG008AB;GET STARTED!
3069;AF009Y;They let down their guard. Guess they aren't taking it seriously.
5231;AE130_041;At this rate, we will be wiped out. Infantry units, take down the surrounding enemies!
869;AM097BA;That is correct.
857;AK008BC;Here's the enemy!
881;AM188BA;This is for love.
918;AO001AA;RELOAD!
3448;AE210_114;Now destroy those guys, and we can call it even.
448;AY001BE;Thanks!
2043;AO026BA;Reloading! I don't need backup!
2569;AE143_035;What the heck? Bigger anchors are falling down!
1282;AA005ZA;Be careful on the right!
1066;AM102BB;That's what we were taught!
1278;AM102DB;Now's not the time!
837;AM065Y;I've heard about it!
1884;AE002_016;I like my steak well done!
3302;AE138_029;Damn those aliens! Always try to play tricks!
3112;AA116BD;I finally understand. It's no use to run away.
698;AM047CB;WRONG!
1431;AM087DA;You sure your eyes are okay?
951;AE145_068;Spacesuits?
1115;AE006W;In my sight!
528;AM029CB;Denied.
3878;AE143_060;So have the aliens built their civilization free of air pollution?
929;AE119_019;Fire!
3281;AEX04_660;This is Spriggan unit. Target confirmed. Engaging now!
1740;AL008DB;ROAAARRRRR!
2496;AE143_054;What? So you're saying...
7242;AE105_027;If we let them run Rampage, it will result in unimaginable casualties. We must shoot them all down!
1228;AL005AA;WE DID IT!
2357;AT004BD;I'M SUCKING THE WEB! SAVE ME!
1684;AL001DD;AHHHHHHH!
1459;AN004Z;Do you want to go to hell with me?
1420;AE064BC;WHY ISN'T IT DEAD YET?!
2463;AE117_034;I've been looking for you. I thought you ran away.
2103;AA138BD;How can we lose to the wing divers?
1197;AE174_016;Destroy the robots!
1050;AP016BC;Took one down!
2372;AE104_055;It's hopeless! They took us all out!
819;AK001Y;THERE'S THE ENEMY!
1404;AE140_017;I should have gone home.
1098;AE149_001;THERE'S MORE OF THEM!
2102;AF005ZA;They haven't found us. Good opportunity.
2411;AE174_037;All Deroys, confirmed eliminated.
1263;AE013CA;Capture them in the sky!
2235;AZ017K;This is Phobos, preparing for the next attack.
841;AB010DD;Let's fly!
2338;AL002CB;YEAH!
2690;AE162_009;Destroy the teleportation ships with the hooligan cannons.
1551;AN030BB;Wow, it's you!
889;AB006AC;GO! GO!
2660;AA014AC;Fight to the end, no matter what. That's EDF!
898;AM134BA;I won't deny you.
838;AQ003Y;Gah!
1303;AE178_036;Take over the base now!
604;AJ017BE;Come here!
2336;AL010BD;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2895;AE206_017;Number 11 is stationary at a high altitude.
1601;AE145_015;So are decoys.
1494;AE210_139;What is going on?
2058;AA037V;Exterminate the enemies on the ground!
300;AB007CB;HA!
2854;AE116_010;Looks like the aliens are commanding the monsters!
1644;AM116BA;Don't say stupid things.
2176;AE125_020;Run! We'll get blown away!
2287;AEX04_630;We've called the wing divers. They'll be here any minute.
2252;AE161_006;This new creature doesn't look like a big deal.
2713;AA140BA;Because the powered exoskeletons were developed by the military.
1269;AR008AA;Cover the ones down!
2267;AY048DD;From now on, I'm part of your unit.
2193;AT007DD;Attack that thread-spitting creature!
980;AM037CA;Let's go with it!
985;AH004Y;Someone got shot!
1282;AM024BC;Respect!
1603;AC024BD;It's party time!
936;AM045CB;That's not right.
1865;AD019BA;Come here, I'll teach you a lesson.
2291;AL023DB;I'll take the opportunity to check my system now.
2308;AA070BE;What do you add to your Sunnyside Up eggs?
1198;AY076DC;We're partners, right?
1560;AK005DD;The sensor has caught the enemy!
2335;AE206_027;We should be thanking you. Glad you could make it.
2108;AEX04_200;We can take a break soon. Relax for a bit.
732;AM046CA;Not quite.
5625;AE203_008;Strategic Command HQ was attacked by the enemy. I will support you.
2285;AE138_032;Monsters approaching, prepare to engage.
2358;AZ002J;Bomber to Air Raider, we are ready.
1216;AR034BC;Kay got chewed up!
2125;AA031DC;Plasma drive, low output activated.
2143;AE117_050;Aliens are coming at from inside the cave!
1811;AR015BB;Report! One man died!
619;AM024Z;Agreed.
1704;AE171_008;GX1, moving in!
1525;AEX04_704;Heavy tanks have arrived!
956;AB006CB;LET'S FLY!
2242;AEX04_673;This is Bravo, engaging enemy!
3288;AE174_026;The long-legged and short-legged Deroys have showed up together.
1168;AO009AA;I'm out of ammo!
489;AL012DA;Clear!
1186;AE164_013;Get back! Back!
1233;AE129_010;MONSTERS!
821;AP005V;IT'S A HIT!
838;AA050AA;Go carefully.
2499;AF008BC;Captain, request permission to fire.
1814;AL033DA;Okay, let's call it a day.
724;AM075AA;Oh!
1386;AE210_008;Fire away the railgun!
1275;AA097BB;I wanna go home.
1206;AY042DD;Nice meeting you!
1321;AR008X;Hey you! Get up!
1239;AR019DA;Did someone get chewed up?
1557;AE020V;I WON'T LET YOU DIE!
2189;AE198_063;Spotted! Heavy armored aliens!
1707;AA017AA;Just focus on your duties.
898;AY016BC;Mission complete!
2232;AE004_043;Those bastards! Move in!
627;AM030W;Negative.
1545;AO006BB;Reloading! Back me up!
1102;AA075BD;Is something over there?
2213;AE130_042;All units, prioritize your survival.
1990;AE121_045;The artillery fire is too strong!
2989;AA135BD;We are supermen when we're in powered exoskeletons!
1173;AA005FA;Stop it!
1592;AC002DB;We are ready to engage the fight!
1229;AC003BA;I'll show you what I have!
1237;AB004BB;FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN!
997;AN023DC;I will protect you.
2505;AA004Y;My friend is dead, I can't believe that.
1522;AE009AB;SHOOT DOWN THE ENEMY!
867;AB002AC;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
2167;AF027BD;Are we launching the surprise attack or not?
410;AQ006AB;DAMN
1364;AH008DB;Report to the medical center!
2711;AL002AB;E.D.F. E.D.F.
1461;AE108_021;Enough with the comforting!
1691;AE165_010;Teleportation ship destroyed!
1502;AF003DB;The enemy hasn't found us.
991;AC019BE;Can't stop shaking?
3890;AE132_005;The Monster Army is right down below. Watch your steps.
3842;AE180_021;A punch with that much weight behind it can crush the enemy with a single blow.
1875;AA086BB;I don't hate dark and narrow places.
8150;AE112_055;Usually, there are monsters patrolling under the teleportation ships, so the enemies didn't expect that we could break through their defense and approach from the ground.
2382;AE210_110;Would be great if we could take down that ship with us.
1454;AE142_003;Eliminate the monsters!
1135;AK004AA;WE HAVE COMPANY!
1414;AY007BB;I owe you a big one.
1429;AT205DB;Our friend got stuck in the web!
1512;AC011DB;Weapon system, unlock.
3324;AE191_027;These are teleportation devices! Destroy them all!
1042;AO006W;I'M RELOADING!
2448;AA022AC;Never lose your guard, even though there's no enemy around.
1795;AT205DD;Our friend got stuck in the web!
3758;AA015Z;Our lives depend on our shields. Never let go of them.
1484;AE004_012;The mothership is ascending!
1567;AA030DD;Cruise mode sustained.
2457;AE133_034;Seems like the aliens are protecting their breeding ground.
1206;AM134BE;I won't deny you.
3060;AE002_154;We'll be safe once we are on the surface. Now, move it!
1029;AE105_034;Please reply!
2956;AA009BB;It's just pulling the trigger. Piece of cake.
1158;AY076BA;Hey, we're partners, right?
2493;AEX04_676;Delta Team is in position, engaging enemies!
898;AY046BA;Let's fight together.
861;AB001ZA;Let's go!
1426;AL004AA;Whoa!
849;AE027AC;SHUT IT DEAD!
2168;AE150_004;Those monsters act slower at night.
1746;AE134_012;Enemy paratroopers!
1216;AF005BA;The enemy didn't see us.
1064;AB003DB;Ugh!
1799;AI005DB;Stabilizer confirmed. Abnormal.
4341;AE141_069;It's been our goal to destroy the base and now we're only an inch away from success.
1781;AE002_152;We're close to the surface now!
1891;AEX04_606;Sniper Team, engage!
2569;AF015BB;I must move in carefully without being spotted.
1761;AE143_022;It's the teleportation anchors!
1484;AK001AA;THERE'S THE REINFORCEMENT!
3272;AA023X;Being a soldier has been good... until the aliens came.
1750;AM028BE;I'll treat you to a nice meal!
540;AM121BA;WRONG!
1565;AL028BB;The enemy is finished!
912;AY034BB;Yeah.
1011;AM031DC;Sir, yes sir!
772;AM024BA;Respect
1912;AB013BA;I told you, I can't run anymore!
928;AM019DD;AMAZING!
2225;AH004BE;Don't die! Stay alive!
722;AE002_093;BACK UP!
226;AM210BB;AH
2492;AA017BA;I'm lucky today, the bullets won't hit me.
945;AE002_123;Monsters again!
3268;AE110_040;GODDAMN ALIENS! I THINK THEY CAN DO AS THEY PLEASE!
1193;AE145_031;Drones confirmed!
2021;AE170_001;Shit! We can't harm them at all!
1439;AN008DA;Wingdivers at your command.
1215;AE193_003;Let's take a closer look!
1213;AE198_056;A horde of urgentists?
1955;AR040BB;There's a victim!
972;AM018BA;I'm impressed!
971;AJ004BC;What should we do now?
1990;AA014BA;We don't accept immigrants on this planet.
1399;AE158_033;Cover the fencers!
1299;AR036BC;Ken got shooed up!
2774;AE186_053;The battle is not over. Destroy the queen.
823;AP013BD;Defeated it!
590;AQ004W;AHHH!
1582;AM088DD;Are you stupid or what?
1496;AB010BB;They want us to move forward!
1134;AA121BA;I'll kill them all!
1052;AD011DD;Move closer!
1461;AP009BD;We hit it. Next.
1405;AT006DD;GET ME OUT OF THE WEB!
1876;AE196_005;They're turning the city into their nest!
3287;AE133_035;It's not too late! Get rid of all the monsters and the eggs!
5248;AE173_019;That's not the Queen! It's a subspecies, a creature even stronger than the original breed!
1007;AN011AC;My team will join you.
1885;AE211_124;Storm 3, attack!
531;AM033DD;Okay!
970;AM098BC;That's the truth!
2900;AT308BB;Thanks for saving me! Oh, it's you!
3942;AE202_002;They are too powerful! These are not regular species gamma!
4243;AE117_003;Newbie, Ranger 2 went ahead and is engaged in combat now. Go join them now.
3437;AE149_023;Since they're slow, maybe we can shoot them down. Give it a try.
2576;AEX02_014;The Calabans are too slow! Get a chopper!
1189;AE133_014;A huge monster!
1056;AM134BD;I won't deny you.
1185;AM145DC;It's surely out of love.
2476;AE206_014;Multiple drones coming out of number 11.
1283;AE002_143;Maybe something happened.
746;AM172BD;Thanks
1705;AL018DD;Plasma Drive, cool down!
4059;AE144_028;That giant monster is queen to the flying type. Destroy it at once!
1224;AM045W;IT'S COMMON SENSE!
1045;AE202_067;What are you talking about?
927;AM002ZA;I'll protect you.
2179;AE066BC;HAHAHAHAHAHA
844;AM106BC;WRONG
1742;AN021DA;I'll be on your side all the time.
1925;AE183_013;They are alien children?
1222;AE114_060;THEY'RE ATTACKING!
538;AM106BB;Wrong.
905;AN010AC;We will defend you.
2311;AF020BD;Don't get too close, or you will be exposed.
1037;AM096BD;You're not mistaken!
963;AG011AC;Seems they were spotted!
1658;AS006ED;NOOOOOO!
2542;AE170_035;Those first attacks must have damaged her badly!
1536;AE188_009;Flying objects detected!
942;AE103_028;Awesome
1621;AA006ZA;Stay alert in the sky!
3130;AT308BC;Thanks for saving me! Ah, it's you!
1512;AK013BD;Did you hear something strange?
1661;AM072BD;CAN BEAT THOSE EXPECTATIONS!
1567;AN002DA;Looks like I can't leave him alone.
2870;AE104_021;Please tell me, when will we start a counter-attack?
2065;AEX04_101;GARENADE CANNON, OPEN FIRE!
746;AM204BC;Really?
1762;AEX04_241;The sandstorm calmed down a little!
1050;AM151DC;Money is important.
762;AM022Z;I can't do!
1094;AD009BC;They're coming this way!
2578;AE210_029;This is working! Concentrate your fire on the cannon!
1924;AA072DA;I can't believe we need to fly underground!
1075;AC001ZA;Increase output.
1216;AM087BE;I knew this was the case!
1385;AO009BA;The bullets don't come out!
2077;AN019AC;I don't feel like it, but I will obey.
3142;AE198_035;Bargo 4 took too much damage! Prepare to escape!
2484;AA078BC;I can't stand it anymore. I want to go home.
792;AI010BD;I need help!
1141;AM049V;How could that be?
1142;AM109BD;Don't be stupid!
1744;AM025BD;This is what the training does.
969;AY027BE;You're funny!
1723;AEX04_373;CONFIRMED! NEW DRONE TYPE!
1027;AE197_003;There's another one!
2768;AE154_012;There's still other mother monsters. Stay focused.
1466;AY004BB;I barely escaped.
1741;AO017BC;BULLETS, BULLETS!
1915;AA039Y;It's so dark. Turn up the light.
1109;AR001AB;You killed my man!
1403;AF007Y;Let's draw closer to the enemy.
465;AQ004BD;AHHH!
7627;AU111AB;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
2020;AE145_078;Let's hide! Get into the building!
946;AH017BA;KEEP YOUR COOL!
1253;AM136BD;That's not so bad, right?
6705;AU112CB;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
453;AY051BB;Later!
1431;AA023BE;I have someone to protect.
684;AE176_013;ADVANCE!
2038;AB013BB;I told you I can't run anymore!
1797;AM179BA;Because I can't keep myself out of this.
6895;AU172Y;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
1275;AE046BB;Attack your left!
1303;AG011BB;The enemy's here!
476;AM019Y;OK.
2104;AE168_034;We'll launch the attack when the fog is cleared!
1541;AE019DD;DIE FROM MY DANCE!
1473;AR029BB;The boss got chewed up!
1532;AL034DB;I'm going home to sleep.
6731;AE144_015;Anti-aircraft missiles can't handle monsters at close range. Infantry unit, defeat all enemies close to the surface-to-air missiles.
1877;AK010BC;Hey! We got a job to do!
1258;AZ045G;Hit the attack target!
1147;AK012DC;Is there no end to this?
2366;AA028CA;Wingdivers can also fight underground.
444;AM031CA;NO!
2874;AE144_047;Bad news! Mothership number 8 is drawing close!
560;AM057CA;Really?
1861;AE151_001;The whole vanguard was wiped out!
1698;AE127_029;THEY'RE ATTACKING FROM THE SIDES!
799;AM018DB;Nice.
1837;AEX04_462;IT'S THE MOTHER MONSTER!
1770;AE121_001;They really built an outpost!
1521;AC002DC;We are ready to engage the fight!
1445;AM105DB;Yeah, you're right.
899;AM061BB;I can't do that.
1828;AE141_089;The aliens are approaching Beijing.
2494;AEX04_670;This is Panther 4, we've arrived on the scene.
1162;AR009DC;Is it the captain here?
1740;AE190_034;Enemy landing ship confirmed!
2863;AE119_051;Hang on! The support will come, I'm sure!
1653;AQ007DA;NAAAAAHeycallllllllllll
2329;AL009CB;YEAH!
3262;AE160_013;Don't shoot! We don't want to create any unnecessary sound!
993;AS003AB;Let me down!
1951;AE158_037;Shield Bearer successfully destroyed!
2437;AE105_020;Look! The flying saucers were shot down!
711;AH013BA;Is it bad?
1003;AY029BD;Hee hee hee hee hee!
1492;AA095BD;Are giant creatures edible?
1166;AB008V;KEEP FOLLOWING ME!
1765;AP004AB;Saw that? Direct hit!
1106;AE204_003;ADVANCE!
641;AM056CA;Oh yeah?
1635;AM087BB;I knew this was the case!
1626;AB010BC;They want us to move forward!
20224;AE113_037;Attention everyone, this is the chief commander. We discovered an overwhelming gigantic ship among the flying objects. The pylons crashing from the skies are also launched by this ship. This type of ship is now designated as mother ship. Taking down the mother ship will be our ultimate goal.
1572;AE117_043;Aliens are here too!
2289;AE177_036;Cut it out and start working together!
1234;AM088DA;Are you stupid or what?
2537;AF028BA;Since they didn't see us, should we retreat now?
2548;AZ030H;This is what the artillery really has!
1714;AE037BE;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
1215;AE010BC;I'm aiming at you!
1330;AE110_008;Commencing air raids!
860;AM132DC;You saved me!
815;AEX04_194;Defend the Titan!
1279;AR005DC;The captain is gone!
1802;AJ001BE;We're all going to die at this rate!
1850;AEX04_510;Battle robots! Incoming!
2658;AE159_060;The queen of the flying type is heading for the nest.
2059;AE125_017;Enemy landing ships coming up from behind!
1004;AH010AC;We'll get you a medic!
2521;AE106_034;It is our duty to protect citizens, after all.
4186;AE163_040;Don't give up! Even if you're about to be swallowed, just fire at the enemies!
6903;AE211_030;A primer that can control organisms. They are being ruled by an entity that has evolved to the highest degree.
1807;AE131_044;It's amazing that you made it this far!
2704;AA020DD;But no one can stand up to an attack from the sky.
1976;AE002_039;Why isn't there any contact from the ground force?
724;AM155BC;Either way!
1823;AI005DC;Stabilizer confirmed, abnormal!
747;AM012V;That's great!
1761;AF013DD;Hush! They might find us!
1234;AJ010DA;We don't have a commander.
799;AH008BB;You can't die!
385;AP002Y;HIT!
2415;AA050BD;I am more courageous than anyone else.
2325;AN005AB;Don't die on me. I'll protect you.
1332;AA003AA;Always be prepared for battle.
715;AM172BB;Thanks!
3305;AE209_002;They keep gathering around number 11. Why is that?
1655;AO014BE;Crap! I don't have bullets!
1243;AY017DA;Easy peasy!
3496;AE144_040;Moscow has fallen. It suffered great casualties.
930;AM057DC;Just quit it!
1591;AM199BD;I'll tell you in details later.
2617;AE191_019;We're here! Come meet up with us if you're alive!
1524;AE002_113;TAKE OUT ALL MONSTERS!
3029;AE170_026;The enemies are too strong! Any suggestions?
1101;AN016BD;I'll help do the mission.
609;AE143_001;THEY'RE COMING!
1304;AM185BA;This is for revenge.
1811;AA001FC;AAAAAAAAAA
3910;AE170_014;Fencers should be moving along with the railgun. Hope they're all safe.
775;AG004DA;We're found!
2761;AM141DD;There's no other choices than fighting. Am I wrong?
2294;AE036BC;I'll make some juicy steak out of you!
385;AM027AC;Fine.
932;AM083W;Seriously?
1662;AS003BB;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
2448;AA050BE;I am more courageous than anyone else.
1288;AC007BA;Let's start the fight soon!
1666;AE158_011;THAT'S SUICIDE!
1767;AJ011BC;Where's the replacement, Commander?
1248;AEX04_204;Defend the railgun!
1281;AL003BD;E.D.F.
856;AE109_006;Hey, look!
746;AEX04_056;Three more!
457;AB008CA;Yeah!
618;AM204BE;Really?
2537;AL014AB;That's the last one! Extermination complete!
960;AK006AC;Prepare for battle!
2380;AA012AB;Count on each other as brothers. Fight together!
3502;AE114_030;One head, two eyes, with hands and feet, bipedal.
1658;AA026DC;Stabilizer, all normal.
1762;AE120_020;So, you survived, newbie.
2519;AY041DB;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
584;AM038DA;Understood.
2608;AA019Z;We can die once we've turned the tides.
1293;AZ018H;BLOW THEM AWAY!
2001;AD006AB;Take aim! Fire when they get in range!
1427;AA025DD;Aerial unit checked.
3228;AA135BB;We are supermen when we are in powered exoskeletons!
1876;AEX04_505;The enemy is protected by a light barrier!
538;AM062BA;Sorry.
2013;AEX04_252;It's very dangerous to fight in the dark!
7570;AU131CA;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
2894;AE138_066;Looks like it won't be an easy win. We'd better get prepared.
1008;AE179_055;It doesn't open!
1278;AM165DB;I don't believe it!
2600;AN016AB;We're responsible for your safety. Let's move.
2776;AZ031PA;Why would a civilian know about this line?
1967;AE005_047;Don't forget to subscribe to my channel!
1601;AL034DA;I'm going home to sleep.
1494;AR002AB;How dare you shoot my men!
1345;AM063Y;Did you hear what you just said?
585;AM045DA;I can't!
1215;AE173_006;Are the citizens safe?
1080;AE177_028;Enemy signs ahead!
1247;AS007BC;Somebody help me!
2153;AM196BB;I did it after listening to others' opinions.
3635;AEX04_540;Is that Arceus? He's huge!
2338;AZ028PB;You're an extraordinary man, aerator.
6705;AU142Y;Here still I will fight the endless screen There's no one home to wait for me
744;AG012BA;Come here!
2399;AE002AC;ARGHHHHHHH rock paper scissors
685;AT102DC;It's a trap!
2762;AE120_017;Monsters are coming. Let's exterminate them
1291;AL011Z;All hunted down?
725;AE006AA;SHOOT!
1454;AR007Y;Stay still! They'll come for you!
2577;AE205_003;This is Storm Four. We're engaging the monsters!
2187;AT004BE;I'M STUCK IN THE WEB! SAVE ME!
1412;AA084BB;Can't see without light.
1547;AZ022Q;Container disconnect.
3199;AE171_040;Target hit confirmed! It should cause damage to it!
1141;AM093BE;This is obvious!
1610;AK006DB;The scout has spotted the enemy!
1692;AA042BA;Is there someone waiting for you at home?
545;AM035ZA;Thank you.
1727;AM089BB;That's what the officer told us, too.
2384;AJ002W;Wait! I'm thinking of an operation plan!
1081;AY010BD;You're my hero!
697;AJ003BB;Crap!
3874;AE145_008;Damn mothership, do they plan to occupy this place and make it a colony?
408;AQ007BB;Crap!
1193;AR006AB;Hold on! Get up!
3155;AEX04_431;These are like steel wires! Watch out for their threads!
2535;AQ005FC;AHHHH!
658;AM001BC;Hold on!
1325;AM086BB;So that's how it is!
1094;AM110DA;You're a genius!
1566;AM192BC;I simply wanted to do so.
1629;AR006CB;Forget about the dead!
2026;AL003CB;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1990;AA137BC;Fencers are the strongest soldiers.
719;AY032DA;I'm sorry.
2194;AE142_016;Are these the same ones that invaded Europe?
1897;AE149_012;Eyes up! More are coming!
2948;AE186_055;This is Scout. Flying types have appeared from the nest!
1762;AEX04_042;All aliens exterminated.
733;AM165BA;Let me thank you.
2216;AY021DC;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
1079;AM174BE;LET ME THANK YOU!
1900;AE104_017;If only they were created by man!
730;AO014DB;Landing!
2458;AEX02_011;The Caliban will pick you up. Hang in there.
3131;AE113_021;Seems like they dug holes and are hiding underground.
1290;AM020DD;We can't lose!
483;AM056BC;YES!
743;AM050CB;Not quite!
866;AM005BA;I'll back you up!
3901;AE179_007;The gigantic unloader should be in the underground storage. Let's find it!
1133;AE013DB;No problem!
1373;AEX02_005;Private, pull it together!
1657;AM083X;Because I have something to protect!
1922;AE151_007;We've got plenty of fuel!
1514;AA003AC;Always be prepared for battle.
1100;AH008BE;YOU CAN'T DIE!
1075;AL005DA;Ooh!
1289;AE184_006;A GIGANTIC WEB!
1703;AA019ZA;Spriggans should keep flying.
1477;AM027BD;You deserve my praise!
2047;AA137BA;The Spencer's are the strongest soldiers!
3435;AA020BB;I've managed to survive this long. How can I die now?
1516;AR005BB;Captain, hold on!
1873;AF002X;Haha, we're not sighted.
2144;AE142_008;Monster's over there too! Hurry up!
1722;AE168_036;Let's strike when the fog clears up!
3321;AE195_001;Contact has been broken with the Vanguard. We're here to rescue them.
2657;AEX04_570;This is Ranger 9, engaging the enemy!
556;AM046DC;Sorry.
2223;AE014Y;I can't handle this on my own! Help!
1576;AL022CA;Activate the maintenance system.
2248;AF017BD;Lower your voice or they will find us.
800;AM139BB;That's the rumor.
1456;AT202BD;Someone's caught on the web!
1862;AE002_082;The rescue teams will definitely come.
1661;AA093DD;I was an airshow performer!
1428;AM069Y;Did you hear what you just said?!
4146;AE204_012;If we don't do something about them, there won't be a place to return to!
1086;AD020BB;Crap! Too far!
1119;AD016DB;Can I pull the trigger?
1491;AG002CB;Let's start firing combat!
1275;AG006DD;The enemy is attacking!
1763;AE200_013;We have to find another way!
1773;AE136_011;There's another mysterious monster?
953;AM053DD;Impossible!
1079;AM005Y;We have someone injured!
1038;AG008Y;The enemy found us!
5416;AE143_063;Correct. These aliens are intelligent, but I don't think that they can surpass human beings.
4434;AEX02_033;There are monsters out there! It's not safe here anymore! Tell us where to hide!
2819;AE146_026;That was amazing! Who are you, really?
7835;AE106_014;After some detailed analysis, we have figured out the conditions in which the alert mode switches to combat mode. There are three conditions.
897;AL009BC;Ugh!
5720;AE117_009;So, you're the last member. Can't believe they sent a newbie on such a dangerous mission.
1699;AS002FC;AAAAAAAAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHAGHG
504;AQ002BD;Ugh!
1085;AT005AC;Target that thing!
1857;AJ002DC;SEND BACKUP! HURRY!
597;AY038BE;Greetings!
695;AM201BC;What?!
3358;AF012BB;Sweet, the enemy is surprisingly careless.
1128;AM101BA;IT'S COMMON SENSE!
28381;AE105_033;So far, no substantial information about the flying objects could be obtained. Governments of all countries are still denying any sort of involvement. However, there are only a limited number of forces that can perform such a large-scale attack. In order to find out the truth, the suspected parties should be closely monitored. Investigations ought to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. But currently, all measures are being hindered by the current situation.
1561;AE155_005;THERE'S A MONSTER ON THE WEBS!
446;AM037BD;Sure.
1556;AM114DC;You love daydreaming.
3289;AA021Z;There won't be enemies tomorrow because we are here!
1014;AB004ZA;Go, go!
1726;AM175BE;Because I'm the ally of justice.
2998;AZ039H;Never heard your voice before. Who are you?
1305;AY077DB;Hey, we're buddies.
1585;AE050BA;NOW! ATTACK YOUR LEGS!
1905;AD004CB;Shoot right after you enter the range!
2260;AL006V;EDF! EDF!
1051;AF025BC;Can we attack now?
1713;AE133_015;It's as big as a building!
1741;AE127_028;They're coming from both sides!
1980;AB005X;Okay, okay, I'll run!
7643;AU021W;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
845;AM023BB;Master!
4264;AEX04_262;The monsters become dull at night. We have to finish them off before dawn.
896;AM116DA;I got that!
1396;AEX04_031;Five aliens left.
789;AC001DD;Go, go!
813;AE170_009;It's you!
1826;AK015BC;Looks like our job is not finished yet!
2612;AE146_044;Escape on your own? That's ridiculous!
2329;AE151_011;You really made it here! This is hell!
3811;AEX01_011;The Spriggan Unit has arrived! Better not get on the wrong side!
1583;AE122_013;DAMN, THEY'RE DEVILS!
1710;AE198_052;They are a real pain.
927;AP002DB;One killed!
1590;AE002_014;Unlock the blast door!
1932;AM191BC;I did it out of spontaneity.
1023;AG005DA;The enemy saw us!
900;AQ008BC;I've been shot!
1186;AM049W;You didn't think it through.
910;AQ007AA;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1384;AV002Y;Someone got caught in the web!
772;AA075BA;Is something over there?
7613;AU171CB;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
2931;AA129BA;Only the powered exoskeletons could carry this heavy weapon.
1548;AM091BB;It's also written in the books.
1927;AF010BC;We should be able to take down the enemy now.
964;AM079AC;I can't believe it!
1017;AM004W;Someone is injured!
1661;AA092BC;The enemy must be hiding somewhere.
1081;AM002CA;The wound is nothing!
422;AM041DB;No.
845;AM036BD;Sounds good.
1893;AT103DD;I can't move! Help me!
388;AQ003BC;Gah!
3233;AZ012M;And never seen before code. Who was that?
1388;AZ010Q;Dropping coordinates confirmed.
2039;AM177BD;Because all I know is fight.
652;AE138_053;FORWARD!
4501;AE129_066;Powered exoskeletons, buy as much time as you can before the demolition team falls back.
2754;AE153_026;Nix4 is engaging the enemy, providing support.
1412;AJ010BA;Should we really stay here?
923;AM064BB;Not possible.
977;AE023BA;Eat the bullet!
3253;AEX04_073;The air raid is starting any moment. Watch out for friendly fire.
3187;AE109_036;Come on! In a situation like this, we all get it!
3205;AEX04_706;Support vehicles dispatched. Have the wounded get on the Caliban.
1431;AT204AB;Rescue those trapped by the net!
1339;AE133_017;WE CAN'T HANDLE THIS!
574;AM038BC;Okay!
959;AY019DA;Hahaha
1113;AZ021Q;Container drop
1952;AM025BB;This is what the training does!
791;AM022W;Yes sir!
1720;AEX04_419;They're fast and hard to deal with!
2407;AA008ZA;I will prove that Spriggans are invincible!
5067;AE136_020;We need new strategies to defeat it. I'm sorry, but that's retreat for now.
1735;AY013BB;Thank you! I love you.
1641;AF010DC;We'll be found if we get too close.
2346;AE145_059;They are deceptively fast for their size!
1575;AA011DA;My body feels heavy today.
1928;AE130_028;THE PLASMA CANNON IS ACTIVATING!
2062;AK016BC;The job will never end!
1238;AG006DC;The enemy is attacking!
911;AM160BD;You saved me!
6740;AU122BC;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
1956;AE164_020;Now, start attacking the mothership!
7074;AE141_070;As soon as the base is gone, the aliens won't be able to maintain control over the ground. We are witnessing history in the making.
1010;AM130BD;Just you wait!
1388;AM147DD;I wanna be famous!
2308;AE198_003;EMC, concentrate attack on Urgenus.
1868;AA072DB;Can't believe we need to fly underground.
2665;AN006Z;Hell can wait. I have to protect you first.
1393;AA028AB;Stay alive, no matter what.
778;AH009BC;Hold on, buddy!
608;AE005ZA;Fire!
650;AM007DC;Don't give up!
938;AW001Z;That was close.
1040;AM184BD;This is for my lover.
3176;AE194_014;Gigantic Unloader Barga! Storm the enemy lines!
2599;AEX04_524;Monsters are being dropped from the teleportation ships!
2353;AE105_004;Human beings can't create something that huge!
2130;AE126_020;Very nice, Super Newbie.
1573;AEX04_594;Rocket Launchers, moving in!
564;AY066BB;My bad.
1257;AI004DD;SYSTEM DAMAGED!
842;AF001AA;Stay calm.
1180;AM062Y;You're a real genius.
1027;AM034X;Of course not!
1325;AE179_066;This must be it!
1105;AY027DD;You're funny!
2458;AA031BA;Our superior's operation plans are perfect.
1754;AE125_029;Looks like someone is earlier than us!
1938;AE105_046;Look! It's a cannon, isn't it?
2005;AN002CB;It's alright. We'll protect you.
691;AM095BC;That's right.
1432;AJ009DA;We must complete the mission.
510;AM029W;GOT IT!
1095;AM068BA;Let's talk about it later.
7924;AU171AC;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt on the front. We are the brave heroes and we fight on
946;AL014X;Really tough!
876;AP007Z;IT'S FINISHED!
2367;AF011DD;Let's sneak up on an unaware enemy and beat it!
2214;AE138_041;The Grim Reapers, are they really coming?
1151;AE176_054;ATTACK ARKALAS!
595;AE005DD;Shoot!
2672;AE211_105;What? How?
4508;AE006_014;The mothership seems to have immeasurable power. We can't let it cause more casualties.
4773;AE004_066;No way we're losing the ground battle! Hold the front line! Earth belongs to us!
4971;AE197_019;Rendezvous with the other troops, concentrate your fire, and take out those anchors one by one.
2316;AA021W;There's no other choice than fighting, am I wrong?
3693;AE210_127;Attack the central bottom of the command ship! Aim at the bottom center!
939;AP006DC;Direct hit!
1782;AN005CB;Our squad will be under your command!
1351;AE163_030;Flying aliens!
1744;AE005_030;EMC, ready to fire!
442;AM161DB;AHH!
1999;AI005X;Damn! Back me up!
2751;AA083DB;This operation? Is the Commander serious?
1134;AI005BA;The injury is nothing!
1343;AS004FA;Stop it!
2268;AI002V;It's nothing. Just a scratch.
2215;AEX04_450;Aggressive alien species gamma!
11476;AE172_003;The alien has constructed an outpost to fortify their defenses. Inside the light barriers, teleportation anchors continue on producing monsters. If we fail to destroy it, we'll probably lose the area.
5546;AE112_044;If we can shoot down the large flying saucers, the aliens' plan will fail, and it will be OUR victory!
1923;AE146_013;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1379;AE029X;I'M INVINCIBLE!
1613;AE123_019;ENEMY TROOPSHIPS APPROACHING!
1521;AL019BB;We just killed the last one!
2124;AEX04_534;IT'S THE MYSTERIOUS MONSTER, URGINOUS!
1120;AM092X;What is happening?
1542;AEX04_355;Confirmed! Big anchor!
2954;AL004DC;E.D.F.!
1059;AA034BB;Don't go crazy!
1025;AM159DC;No way!
2228;AEX04_293;CONFIRMED, LONG TYPE DEROY
1984;AE048BB;NOW, ATTACK ITS RIGHT SIDE!
3983;AE106_005;Sergeant, do you hear me? We have info about the flying saucers.
1372;AY074BD;This'll work fine.
790;AQ002DA;AHHH!
1660;AM024DD;Do you want me to praise you?
2415;AE203_015;Enemy landing ship confirmed.
866;AE100_012;Who is this?
2736;AA002BC;This is why I became a soldier. Leave it to me.
872;AP002AA;We got one!
1434;AM077AA;I can't believe this!
1004;AM013X;Pretty skilled!
573;AM020Z;NO!
2291;AN036BE;You must be the ace! Nice to meet you!
846;AG007BB;We're found!
1411;AL007BA;Hooray!
1287;AC026DA;Countdown to the battle!
1460;AA018V;Don't let your guards down!
1116;AA067BC;Why are you here?
1271;AC009AB;End of chit-chat. Let's go.
1289;AK004BB;The sensor shows something!
2394;AEX04_714;Powered exoskeletons engage.
2722;AT005CB;Ugh! I'm stuck in the web!
1115;AO003W;Reloading ammo
822;AY018DC;Should be clear!
2004;AN028BC;You, to be our captain.
1444;AEX04_455;Our bullets can't kill it!
5028;AE210_014;This is our final stand. I'm just glad I'll go out in a blaze of glory!
2061;AD017BC;Shoot them dead once they're in range!
1136;AM042DD;That's not gonna work!
2109;AE180_004;Too many. We don't stand a chance.
1108;AE180_035;Aliens in sight!
1536;AF033BA;And it also leads to victory.
1148;AC026DC;Countdown to the battle!
911;AG002BE;They found us!
1173;AG014BA;COMING THIS WAY!
1704;AA098BE;Let me breathe the air outside.
468;AN012CA;YOU?!
996;AK003Z;New reactions!
935;AM130BC;JUST YOU WAIT!
1013;AO004CB;POWER CONTROL!
3961;AZ007PB;I want to know the enemy's coordinates. Civilian, can you tell me?
663;AM034CB;That's right.
1191;AZ019I;It's a bombing request!
749;AEX04_146;Operation!
975;AD009DA;Ready to shoot!
6514;AE210_016;Attack on the mother ships has failed. Five more cities have been destroyed. All bases have been destroyed.
1453;AH012BC;We'll give you some medicine later!
1962;AM190BC;Because I want money and fame.
1426;AC015DC;Activate the shock absorber.
3448;AE168_020;The reinforcement is rushing to the scene. Hang on until they arrive.
725;AY045DB;Good evening.
670;AM043CB;Wrong.
2613;AE140_039;For that name belongs to the legendary hero.
1131;AM010X;You're doing great!
1787;AS009BC;I'M OVER HERE! SAVE ME!
1809;AR008BA;I can't believe the captain is chewed up!
1584;AE111_020;It's impossible to kill them all!
1317;AB003BB;MOVE FORWARD!
1604;AC008BB;We're almost in the enemy's range.
3140;AE134_007;All we have is shotguns! The enemy ships are out of range!
360;AB006BE;GO!
1779;AZ010N;Tempest! Fire!
1586;AJ004Y;We can't fight without a commander!
1322;AH021BB;WE HAVEN'T INJURED HERE!
331;AQ006BC;AH
1918;AA085DB;I so wanna go back outside.
2959;AEX04_433;Their armor is too thick! Our bullet simply bouts off!
1326;AO005W;Reloading! Back me up!
592;AQ001FB;AHHH!
1142;AM018AA;That's worth a medal!
2117;AE121_069;There are some drones remaining. Shoot them down.
651;AM105BE;I knew it!
1570;AA029DC;Flight system all checked.
958;AE186_034;They've returned!
18213;AE109_033;Attention everyone. This is the chief commander. The enemy is coming from the sky. There is nowhere safe on Earth. The Earth is turning into a battlefield now. I hope all of you are prepared and ready to stand on the front line.
1878;AS007BA;Somebody help me!
1559;AA051AC;Let's enjoy the cave exploration.
1725;AE128_034;It's the enemy artillery unit!
1432;AE001AC;Fiiiiiiirrrrrrrrghr!
1186;AD009BB;They're coming this way!
648;AL016BE;We won!
395;AM087Y;WHAT?!
1361;AM113BB;And you really think so?
518;AC002Z;Round up!
564;AM125DB;Thank you.
314;AM076AC;WHAT?!
4252;AE176_068;We intended to kill Archilas, but surprisingly the blazer didn't work.
769;AM060BC;Impossible.
1902;AA072DC;I can't believe we need to fly underground.
898;AM022AB;I'll remember that.
1879;AL004V;YEAH!
1639;AL036BD;It's finally over.
1275;AL004BB;Whoa!
4564;AE186_056;Flying types keep emerging from the nest. Put an end to this! Destroy the nest!
824;AT101BA;SAVE ME!
2020;AE166_038;These bastards are crazy.
7578;AU121W;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucers, shooting down our foe
668;AM131DA;Thank you!
798;AF014DD;Shut up!
1381;AO012DA;Cool Down starts now!
975;AD001BB;The enemy is here!
5020;AE211_130;They are all wounded, but we've tried our best to gather everyone who can still fight.
6491;AE113_047;Air raid has already failed, but if we approach the mother ship from the ground, it is possible to do some damage.
1943;AA002ED;AHHH AHHH AHHH AHHH AHHH
1204;AS003DA;Help!
2045;AT109BB;Over here! I'm over here!
641;AQ002AC;AHHH!
1350;AM154BE;I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT!
7612;AU171W;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
356;AQ005BC;Gah!
2491;AA054AA;Be careful not to accidentally shoot one of us in the dark.
1008;AA071BE;What is your purpose?
1237;AP014DB;Target down!
1897;AA008DD;A nice breeze of wind.
1251;AP013DC;That one is killed!
1562;AE127_012;So the alien is a leader!
1883;AE200_025;Shieldbearers have been eliminated!
2481;AT305BB;I'm free! It's all thanks to you!
2602;AN004DD;You're a brave civilian. I'll protect you.
8014;AE141_084;An enormous amount of aliens are approaching. We've never seen this many enemies in this area. We're coming up with a defense plan right now.
952;AM168BB;Thank you, sir!
1879;AE129_022;Teleportation ships confirmed!
2657;AE176_074;There should be mobile cranes in base 228.
3844;AE202_047;Fine?! What the hell is fine about it?! My friends were in there!
1692;AN010DD;I'll be in charge of protecting you.
1058;AE061BA;Please hit the target!
1523;AE173_015;Aliens with wings!
4024;AE129_032;Oh no, if we lose the sandstorm, they'll spray us with bullets!
3168;AE116_005;We're so much alike! Do we really need to fight each other?!
762;AE155_028;Break the web!
1820;AL049BE;Time to find the next enemy!
773;AO001BD;Loading!
1618;AE171_012;GX2, attack!
1118;AY074BA;This'll work fine.
4237;AE104_029;This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. We will support you in the combat.
1112;AE138_003;Commence Airstrike!
963;AL014BC;Neutralized!
1969;AC021BB;Stay calm. I have to stay calm.
3695;AEX02_008;Recruits! I'll get you all out of here! Don't give up!
42323;AE119_060;The war with the primers is far from over. Although EDF is able to stand against the enemies, the situation is becoming more overwhelming. We have the upper hand, but the situation has become stagnant. It is now a competition of patience, and the one who persists till the end will win. But there is no need to worry. We have prepared a trump card for this kind of situation, namely our three submarine carriers. The three carriers were immediately dispatched after the war begun, and they are waiting patiently under the sea. As long as we have Siren, Pandora, and Epimetheus at our disposal, we can still put up a fight.
1227;AS003BA;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
1625;AE121_046;We can't take it anymore!
2205;AA088DB;I feel like I'm assimilated with those bats.
1803;AE058BC;Huh? WOAH!
4553;AE148_024;If we miss one, it'll be a horrible disaster. You need to destroy them all.
1242;AM088DC;Are you stupid or what?
1608;AA009DC;The sky today is pretty.
1070;AR014BE;One man down!
1089;AN019DD;Take me with you!
3839;AE163_008;AFV, move on! Infantry unit, cover the AFV!
1343;AA011BA;Let's get serious today!
993;AL009Z;Eliminated.
7713;AU111DB;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
1727;AA057DA;I don't dislike idiots.
987;AE053BC;We're in combat!
690;AM028DB;YEAH!
2589;AI016DA;I'm sorry! I don't think I can make it back!
1121;AM109DA;Let's do it your way.
626;AB005V;Mowat!
1795;AO027BB;Reload! No need to cover me!
2285;AE135_010;Darts! Watch out for the darts!
1285;AC003DD;I will follow the plan!
494;AM026DB;Got it.
1329;AK013BB;Did you hear something strange?
1156;AR013BE;ONE MAN DIED!
2322;AE177_018;Those heavily armed bastards are hard to handle.
2622;AE155_032;Can't believe such horrible creatures exist.
2666;AE172_012;Shield Bearers destroyed! Shields are down!
863;AM124DC;You saved me.
3150;AE110_007;The Air Force is attacking! All infantry, back off!
1756;AE132_024;There are more monsters than expected!
755;AG003Z;Charge!
5409;AE202_012;We believe it's a subspecies of aggressive alien species gamma with higher combat strength.
1290;AM083Y;I heard that it's a decent job.
889;AM181BA;This is for honor.
3155;AE174_004;Commence operation! We must stop them here!
1779;AE184_016;Anchor successfully destroyed!
1567;AEX02_010;THE INJURED WON'T MAKE IT!
1162;AP016BA;Took one down!
937;AY070DD;Fine by me!
2162;AE211_075;Ten motherships are still on the move.
373;AP001DD;Hit!
2152;AE161_015;Two teleportation ships are approaching.
765;AM001DA;Hang in there.
2603;AT106DB;I'm not able to move at all!
445;AQ001DD;AH
1220;AM164DB;What's going on?
709;AE002_168;Yes sir!
1380;AC016DD;Switch to reckless mode.
625;AZ017PB;Fire!
1046;AM200BB;It's a long story.
1484;AL018DC;Plasma Drive, cool down.
1935;AA054DB;Beauty is a sin, indeed.
1714;AE172_001;It's like a glowing castle!
1246;AM050DD;That's way too hard!
877;AE004Z;Take this!
1016;AY008BC;I'm so grateful.
990;AM054BA;I'll take care of this!
2113;AE115_021;Don't forget what I just taught you!
1063;AM048X;I think so too!
665;AM044W;Agreed!
1349;AM057BE;I'll figure out something!
1363;AQ004FA;AHHHHHHH!
972;AE178_028;Is that a hooligan?
622;AY052DB;Bye-bye.
942;AY031BA;That's a shame.
1101;AE210_089;HEEEEELP!
1218;AY031DD;What a shame.
742;AB008AC;GET MOVING!
754;AE002_047;Monsters
3552;AA065DC;This job is dangerous. What keeps you from leaving?
1381;AE049BC;Now, attack the head!
1327;AA034DA;I'll cover you from the sky.
899;AM019BA;THAT'S AMAZING!
1214;AK008DC;I feel an enemy nearby!
1247;AE004_060;What exactly are these?!
483;AM025DB;Okay!
2170;AE124_008;The situation is so despairing!
725;AM030X;Sounds good.
1156;AM142BA;Can I call your teacher?
1220;AC003ZA;Approaching the enemy!
1129;AA004V;Watch your backs!
2072;AE002_086;Why are the monsters attacking the base?
3231;AA067AB;Our weapons rival Panzers. There's nothing to be afraid of.
1915;AT205AB;Destroy the nest! Save our men!
1659;AK010BD;Hey, we got a job to do!
3885;AE176_058;An immortal monster really exists. The universe is full of surprises.
2449;AA017BE;I'm lucky today, the bullets won't hit me!
1187;AE113_001;Protect the civilians!
429;AM046AA;Fine.
1597;AK010DD;Looks like there's something approaching.
1684;AE004_028;It's the alien infantry unit!
1538;AE005_013;ALL VEHICLES HALT!
2358;AA059BD;Are you a soy sauce or ketchup person?
2721;AE014AA;We won't lose if we go by our training. Shoot!
603;AE027BA;Bring it!
3388;AE002_033;The elevator's not moving. The cables are all destroyed.
880;AE205_015;FINISH THEM!
1364;AD007V;Too far! Draw them in!
1257;AM150BD;Alright, I got it.
2346;AE177_012;Show them what the blazer can do!
1611;AA066AA;Don't let rangers beat us to it.
1451;AN033BD;Can I have your autograph later?
1427;AD021DA;Confirm shooting range.
3164;AE171_001;Infantry unit, advance along with the powered exoskeletons.
7549;AU161BE;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is signless now cause not a soul was spared
726;AB016BA;RUN!
1824;AE128_019;I won't let them pass!
2581;AE164_026;Drones and it's type 2
1426;AK005DA;The sensor has caught the enemy!
2750;AA038AB;As they say, it's a winnable battle, and we will win.
998;AE210_048;What's going on?
1106;AE030BC;Leave it to me!
1664;AE130_030;The laser cannons are activating!
1861;AJ002Y;What do we do? What do we do?
802;AT101DB;Ahhh!
1206;AM183BE;This is for my wife!
4675;AO012X;My bullets are gone! Found them, thank goodness.
2935;AE001_046;We can't make contact with the ground! We are isolated!
1804;AS015BE;Somebody kill this guy!
780;AI010BB;I need help!
1431;AM191BA;I did it out of spontaneity.
1116;AG017BB;Fire! Fire!
769;AC003AA;Keep your guard up.
2970;AE136_003;Cease fire. Move to target point and stand by.
1754;AA005X;I'm gonna take a leave when all's done.
3874;AE171_005;We can leave the hard work to powered exoskeletons and relax!
3995;AE164_012;This is Scout! The mothership has activated its cannons!
697;AY068BA;That's all right.
2630;AE171_020;Guerrilla unit, defend the powered exoskeletons!
1281;AG016BC;IT'S SHOWTIME!
1394;AM144BB;Was it in your dreams?
4386;AE211_064;How? How can we defeat something like that?
1827;AL026DB;The opponent got nothing on me!
3076;AE208_004;That device could teleport their entire army to Earth.
1248;AA095BE;Are giant creatures edible?
709;AM047AA;Let's go with it.
1367;AE155_002;ELIMINATE THE MONSTER!
1275;AEX04_049;Enemy count, four.
859;AM158DA;What's this?
3747;AE138_067;The Alien Army is getting close. We have no time to rest. Keep on fighting!
1969;AEX04_289;CONFIRMED GIGANTIC ANCHOR
871;AE005BE;Go to hell!
1148;AD012DA;That's not good enough!
901;AM003AC;Take a deep breath!
3576;AE195_005;If that's the case, we're doomed! We have to get to the bottom of this!
1579;AZ016H;Commence bombing!
1528;AE147_011;All drones are destroyed!
784;AB004DD;Let's move!
1824;AA069AB;Believe in powered exoskeletons.
1428;AA009DA;The sky today is pretty.
1632;AE146_019;There's too many of them!
1042;AP024BE;Did I take it down?
1390;AE131_030;Monsters detected
1275;AR011AA;Forget about the dead!
718;AY043DC;Good morning.
2105;AT004BB;I'm stuck in the web. Save me!
709;AP022BE;H-hit!
6643;AU122BA;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens
4206;AE128_022;Fierce battles are taking place in other areas as well. We have to hold this position.
315;AM058BE;NO
2931;AE135_013;Don't get stung by it! There's no way you can survive!
1165;AM100BA;That goes without saying!
2378;AE006_012;Flying saucers are coming out from a mothership!
1059;AE061BE;PLEASE HIT THE TARGET!
4362;AE143_049;I'm referring to that secret weapon which killed lots of aliens in Beijing.
8902;AE202_079;The egg-shaped ship is a shared motif in all mythologies. I don't think that's a coincidence! The egg-shaped spaceship that carried God must exist!
2690;AE192_012;The monsters just... keep on coming!
3095;AZ006Q;This is Transport Chopper. Civilian, we'll drop off the vehicle.
2127;AR009V;Wait here and stay still! I'll get help!
7665;AU161BB;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
3439;AA103BD;I want to be a hero, but it looks like I can't be one.
2428;AT308DC;Be gentle the next time you save me, okay?
1713;AY064DA;I didn't mean to.
620;AM014DD;Great!
1483;AE166_018;It's the enemy's new equipment!
1753;AL041BE;We can call it a day, can't we?
2201;AC014BB;The enemy is near. I'll take care of it.
406;AM030BD;Got it!
5584;AE211_016;Manipulating light, flying in the sky, as was told in the legends.
2683;AE136_002;Infantry Unit, protect the EMC.
1682;AA096BE;I want to breathe the air outside.
2937;AE202_004;Look! These are not regular species gamma!
7634;AU031DC;High up in the air, our comrades fight Dashing through the sky, now like a million bolts of light
3263;AD009AC;Not close enough! Let's wait for the enemy to get in range first!
2356;AA012BA;Actual fighting is much more fun than training.
1609;AC007DB;SENSOR HAS DETECTED ENEMIES
2726;AE157_002;It's too foggy to see anything, stay alert!
1661;AN026DC;Don't worry, I'm here.
3453;AEX04_404;That one ain't the second lieutenant! The red ones are no joke!
1839;AE121_042;The large cannons are activating!
3883;AZ009Q;Vehicles are en route. Civilian, show me the enemy-free location.
2328;AM008AB;Treatment can wait! Take down enemies first!
1167;AE005_023;IT'S STILL ALIVE!
1478;AE014DD;We can win this battle!
2623;AF002Z;Stupid. They're not aware of us at all.
2867;AE159_070;Retreat after annihilating the Surrounding Flying Type!
1805;AE130_029;The Plasma Cannon is aiming at us!
1726;AL011BC;E-D-F!
1709;AT110BB;Somebody destroy the web!
2549;AE127_003;We're the best insect extermination team!
1554;AEX04_129;Initiating satellite attack.
1827;AD018BC;Take them down when they get closer.
1014;AM123BD;That's not right!
853;AM164BD;I appreciate it.
910;AF011CA;Stay calm.
2647;AZ005PB;I'll grant you to use this power again.
1614;AC011DA;Weapon system, unlock!
1430;AEX04_022;Enemy from both sides!
1697;AN002CA;It's alright. We'll protect you.
665;AH002AC;HOLD ON!
3940;AE206_002;It's on us to take down the mothership? Heh, nice.
1472;AM008BD;Rescue is on the way!
2517;AE163_016;Looks like those aliens are sending out messages!
1274;AL007V;E.D.F.!
1212;AB007BC;Hey, time to move!
1680;AF010DA;We'll be found if we get too close.
3313;AEX03_005;They are using threads to capture their prey. Be careful.
1949;AE137_023;Wingdivers, join the strike team!
31284;AE108_015;Earlier today, EDF made a shocking announcement. According to EDF, the flying objects all around the world are spaceships of an extraterrestrial civilization. EDF also made the radar records public. The data showed the moment when numerous flying objects showed up on the Earth's orbit. The data record was so shocking that everyone at the press conference, including journalists, were speechless. Now, journalists from all around the world are crowding at EDF headquarters, and it's chaotic on the scene.
963;AY064DC;I didn't mean to-
1702;AE065BB;HYOSH!
1267;AO006BA;Reloading! Back me up!
1614;AE060BE;Don't come! Stay away!
1775;AT203BE;Go save the ones caught in the web!
1442;AE001_022;RUN! RUUUUUUN!
1483;AD020BD;Crap! Too far!
1433;AE144_011;Our bullets are useless!
1049;AE105_039;THEY'RE BACK!
1569;AE107_003;This definitely doesn't look good.
2134;AC014BE;The enemy is near, I'll take care of it.
4622;AZ038H;A civilian ordering an air raid? Never heard of anything like this.
1454;AA010BA;I'm not trained for this!
1201;AL027BA;I took down the enemy!
946;AM003BD;I'm coming to help!
1440;AJ016BC;We need a captain!
2948;AE110_014;Haha! This was too easy!
1153;AM050W;You just think about it.
1693;AE210_140;It looks alive!
1661;AC007BB;Let's start the fight soon!
1889;AE163_053;Shit! We got carried away!
1655;AF007Z;Lower down the actuator's sound.
2336;AE034BC;Dare to eat me? Bring it on!
1232;AE152_003;Let's recover the city!
2701;AEX04_479;Those aliens are heavily armed. Proceed cautiously.
1575;AE164_010;DEFEAT THOSE ALIENS!
6911;AU152BC;Why should I still keep on fighting on? Shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn!
1556;AM060W;Can we change the subject?
536;AM025AA;Got it!
1472;AE161_007;Let's eliminate them quick!
681;AY063DB;Forgive me.
1798;AA013V;Always be prepared for battle!
713;AM104DB;Guess so.
2492;AE181_026;Monsters! Ground troops, protect Barga!
4577;AEX04_490;Those aliens are wearing tough armor! Focus your fire on one spot!
1023;AM073BD;Not possible!
2666;AM008AA;Treatment can wait! Take down enemies first!
2341;AE192_001;They're trying to multiply on the surface!
1071;AG007BD;WE'RE FOUND!
2200;AD016BC;Enter the range! Come on!
1770;AT104BE;Bastard! I can't get out!
2093;AT109BE;OVER HERE! I'M OVER HERE!
1830;AS010BE;Bastard let go of me
1095;AE168_023;It's Aranea!
2110;AE171_014;GX4 arriving soon.
1239;AC001CB;The enemy is close!
1196;AY033BC;I'm disappointed.
7534;AU031BA;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
523;AM209BB;AHHH!
1398;AL017Y;Please, I need a break.
1494;AO004AA;Magazine change
1464;AR007AA;HEY! YOU DEAD?!
2024;AK002X;The sensor's sounding off the alarm!
1145;AL024BA;Victory's ours!
3066;AE184_010;Aranea's coming out from the anchors, are using webs to defend it.
1276;AM006DD;Stay strong!
1458;AA028DC;Aurora Steyr, cut.
2917;AE171_023;We've confirmed big anchors. Please be extra careful.
955;AJ009X;That's not funny.
805;AE043BE;Go for the ride!
900;AT101BC;SAVE ME!
1784;AA039AA;We have good chances, so we'll win.
741;AY069BB;Don't worry.
2669;AEX04_718;Barga is being dispatched. Will arrive shortly.
1204;AE173_010;What are those?
2922;AE183_006;I've seen it several times. I even dream about it.
6170;AE104_007;Sergeant, perfect timing. Please support us. There's no time to waste. We must minimize the casualties.
1940;AO012BE;Damn! My magazine is cracked!
1124;AZ005K;Marker confirmed.
2674;AE111_042;THE MONSTERS ARE OUTSIDE, DO SOMETHING!
2577;AEX02_023;This is a rescue chopper! We are under attack!
301;AE115_024;Good.
2413;AE211_043;It sure has a lot of tricks up its sleeve.
793;AE104_044;Up there!
3987;AE142_037;New type monsters confirmed! It's species beta that are covered with armor!
1728;AE158_022;The shield bearers are getting away!
1076;AH005BE;I'LL PROTECT YOU!
3413;AS001Z;AHHHHHHHHHH!!
11632;AE142_044;This is a private message. You have achieved brilliant combat results. Was it pure luck or do you really possess such skills? Either way, you are worthy of attention.
1041;AE193_002;What is that light?
7466;AU011X;Oh, we're the Valiant Infantry. We're the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1369;AM057BB;I'll figure out something!
979;AL012Y;All wiped out!
974;AE210_004;MOVE THE RAILGUN!
754;AS004AC;ATTACK IT!
738;AG013BA;Oh no!
1070;AM024X;I understand, sir!
1176;AE020AA;Take aim at the right!
1054;AE157_003;Aliens
617;AE004DB;Fire!
524;AB016BC;RUN!
3427;AN009DC;Because there's no commander here, we'll join forces with your team.
1214;AL017BC;Go find other enemies!
2344;AE142_034;Lots of monsters coming out from the holes!
809;AQ009BE;I've been hit!
1445;AE131_006;Take down the target quickly!
1705;AD006W;Shoot them once they draw closer!
4055;AEX04_251;These are drones. They won't go easy on us just because it's turned dark.
1107;AY007BA;I owe you a big one.
1105;AO005AB;Swap new magazines!
1530;AE107_040;Being a soldier is awesome!
1469;AE007DA;Let's destroy the target!
1470;AD017DB;Come on, get into range!
4760;AE105_074;A great number of drones were dispatched from the gigantic ship. There are thousands of them!
1389;AT201CA;Rescue our buddies caught in the web!
1635;AR001CB;I'll take my revenge!
2013;AA011V;Eliminate them, understood?
1139;AO028BB;Swat the magazine!
805;AH003BD;Evade!
4990;AE165_006;The species' gamma is extremely dangerous. We must destroy the teleportation ship's ASAP.
1392;AB012BE;I'm tired already!
840;AE002_046;What was that sound?
2480;AE145_020;We support each other. Don't act alone.
2183;AE168_039;Monsters confirmed! Ready to attack!
2130;AE122_010;We can't win! Pull us out!
736;AM020BE;Good job!
535;AM022CA;Okay!
1525;AEX04_302;CONFIRMED MOTHERSHIP
4192;AA009W;Even under these circumstances, I still think that it's awesome being a soldier.
696;AE100_032;Well done!
1142;AM039V;YOU'RE WRONG!
1116;AD008DB;Entering the range!
839;AM042AA;I'll think about it!
1533;AA056DD;I hate idiots.
2037;AE205_002;Hurry! Rescue Storm Four!
1226;AH007BB;I won't let you die!
1310;AC005ZA;Unlock weapon system!
1609;AE153_010;Nixx3, secure the right!
1864;AZ030PB;What? You're not a soldier?
821;AM053BD;Leave it to me!
1730;AA001W;We have to know the situation first.
1273;AEX04_472;The king is here!
868;AB015BC;MOVE! MOVE!
1369;AS016BB;Take down this guy!
3156;AA011W;I'll keep climbing up, and I'll become a general one day.
1151;AN008AC;This team will protect you.
1840;AA049AB;Use the radar and not your eyes!
1153;AM016DB;I'm impressed!
2484;AE005_056;Let's go, tread Print the power of the Sun!
1840;AE002_059;We better get the hell out of here!
1221;AE002_011;Head to the elevator!
3386;AE003_035;Our troops are in combat! We should back them up! Follow me!
1611;AEX04_221;I don't hate the snow.
1625;AE118_030;THE TANK HAS BEEN DESTROYED!
1938;AE115_028;We can only rely on ourselves.
1264;AL015ZA;I haven't had enough.
2245;AE205_005;On the double! Get Storm 4 out of there!
1920;AE190_044;MONSTERS!
851;AL006BB;We did it!
5037;AE105_036;What do you mean by hostile forces? Please tell me which force specifically!
737;AP026BB;That's one!
3080;AN029BD;Is it really okay to let a guy like you to be our captain?
711;AY039BB;All yours.
3463;AA021ZA;You've been trained to fight underground. Now show the results!
878;AE045BC;Attack your right!
1384;AA077BA;Where does this cave lead to?
658;AM039BE;Leave it to me.
530;AE211_133;Damn it!
640;AG002Y;INCOMING!
1432;AN031BD;It's my pleasure to meet you!
1446;AE114_032;The mothership is ascending.
2053;AN026BD;Without a commander, I am troubled.
674;AY001BA;Thanks!
1354;AM057BD;I'll figure out something!
1293;AL029BA;I killed the last one!
2071;AA030Y;I'm satisfied enough to have made it this far.
1025;AP008DD;One defeated!
3544;AT307BE;EDF doesn't leave men behind, but I still want to thank you.
2341;AA019CA;Remember to have the wings repaired when going back.
878;AH003X;We're being attacked!
998;AR024BA;Farewell, comrade.
1402;AP021BE;Nice! One killed!
1554;AA048BE;No one can beat me in poker.
2539;AEX04_713;Dispatching powered exoskeletons.
1448;AC012BD;Ready to fight, aren't you?
3099;AA022BE;I'm transferring to the Logistics Division tomorrow, thanks!
5607;AE144_022;The red monsters appear to be a mutated form of the flying type. Their appearance is almost identical.
1238;AEX04_341;CONFIRMED! ALIEN!
6679;AU142CB;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
3567;AE173_005;The garrison of this region was wiped out. You can count them out.
1979;AL043BE;Can I be discharged after this mission?
671;AO002ZA;Reload.
1190;AY016BB;Mission complete!
1373;AP002CA;Hit! Defeated it!
2048;AA053BB;Have you ever wondered why this would happen?
1326;AM088W;WHAT IS GOING ON?!
1386;AE016Z;Destroy the target!
2436;AD015DD;I can't wait any longer. Let me shoot!
1365;AP011BB;I took one down!
528;AH002DC;Dodge!
4321;AE154_006;The aliens are protecting those monsters. It's too dangerous to deal with them all at once.
1343;AEX04_625;Wingdiver, straight ahead!
3268;AE128_045;It's okay. I want to provide as much support as possible.
1734;AA037AB;No retreat, no surrender.
2905;AE194_001;Is that mothership number nine?
641;AM054CA;Thank you!
684;AM062BD;I'm sorry.
926;AB006DC;Prepare to fly!
2864;AA025AA;Exercise your body, but exercise your mind more.
1590;AA060DC;What is the reason you joined the EDF?
1619;AA014DC;Watch me dance like a bird!
906;AP006AA;One down!
2081;AT003DB;Ugh, got stuck by the web!
1289;AB014DC;I don't want to run anymore!
758;AM025Z;I'm with you.
1964;AF004AB;We can get close to the enemy without notice.
2620;AE157_004;Crap the fog is getting thicker
1999;AE143_051;Looks like it's top secret, huh?
3675;AZ002I;Artillery squad to air raiders, we're ready to begin another round of bombing.
1021;AM127DD;Thank goodness!
3407;AZ007O;This is satellite W1, report the enemy's location now.
1503;AN029DB;Is it really you?
1359;AT201DA;Allies got stuck!
812;AY055BE;I'm going to sleep.
1775;AEX04_622;Wingdriver, offering support.
1463;AA089DD;Birds can't fly at night.
2424;AE210_083;The command ship is protected by a shield!
2444;AT101AA;Damn, I can't move!
1027;AR011AB;Forget about the dead!
976;AE163_002;ASSAULT!
1362;AE002_073;MONSTERS INCOMING!
990;AE172_006;Ready to attack!
1214;AA047AB;Are you scared of the dark?
3043;AI007W;If I die, give my annuity to my family.
511;AG001CA;NOW!
1720;AR007V;Defend those down!
2485;AF011AC;Let's knock them down quick and clean once we're close enough.
1809;AE127_013;STAY AWAY FROM THE ALIENS!
2002;AD006Y;Come on, come on, come on!
1567;AE104_025;Attack the monsters!
1663;AEX04_585;Shotgunners, engage the enemy!
2437;AT308DD;Be gentle next time you save me, okay?
576;AM052Y;You're wrong.
1979;AI001BA;Crap! My armor is...
1546;AT203DA;Someone is caught in the web!
3762;AE116_011;So the monsters can understand orders given by the aliens?
1769;AA077BC;Where does this cave lead to?
1676;AE112_008;EXTRA MONATO MONSTERS!
1761;AK015BD;Looks like our job is not finished yet!
568;AM068AC;WOAH!
1609;AO005AA;Swap new magazines!
2665;AZ034H;Ugh, it's over. I'm gonna eat.
3153;AE202_027;It seems like the aliens have an issue with global warming.
1584;AE042AA;We will defend humankind!
2288;AF022BB;Don't do anything before the captain fires.
4954;AA095DC;Once you fly in the sky, you hear people applauding. I really missed that.
1270;AE121_020;Drones are approaching!
1951;AA025BE;I will barbecue with my kids on the weekend.
2247;AT002W;IT'S PULLING ME AWAY! SAVE ME!
2419;AE195_022;IT'S OKAY! I'M ALRIGHT!
4382;AE170_024;I saw it with my own eyes. They just ran away without the rail gun.
2109;AA003DA;I can't bring shame to the elite unit!
1773;AE158_021;DESTROY THE SHIELD BEARERS!
1335;AY009BE;Next time, I'll save you!
7746;AU121DB;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
2388;AA039V;Let's find out the enemies lurking in the dark!
1343;AE161_020;Are they trying to crush us?
2263;AF013CB;Keep down the power, or they'll find us!
608;AL021AC;It's done.
4941;AE111_015;There are too many of them! If they all start deploying monsters, we won't be able to kill them all!
685;AY001DC;Thanks!
1394;AZ021H;FIRE MORTARS!
1470;AE128_024;THE TANKS ARE DESTROYED!
1531;AC021DD;I'll show you my moves.
694;AE163_044;Same here!
4338;AE119_004;Please get us the best ingredients! No matter how bad we cook it, it will still be edible!
1904;AF009BC;Captain, let's attack now!
509;AM079BC;Yeah.
3130;AZ001J;Bummer to Air Raider. We're flying in the combat area.
1258;AE138_024;Drones confirmed!
2607;AN007BA;A civilian? Then I can't leave you alone.
4087;AE138_002;Airstrike in three, two, one.
1972;AL048BD;I will receive more medals!
701;AM012BC;You're good!
1518;AJ007BE;AREN'T THE RESCUE TEAMS HERE YET?!
2617;AE103_034;It seems that monsters have appeared in Osaka too!
2356;AE148_004;Why does it have to drop here of all places?
1410;AT105AA;Someone give me a hand!
1308;AI008AC;There are cracks in my armor!
1298;AC006AB;Remove the safety device!
3854;AA024W;No matter what our superiors say, we're in an inferior position.
1190;AM137DB;I've got no choice.
1030;AE132_022;To the monsters!
3766;AE170_012;There should be some abandoned trucks on the roadside. We can use them for cover.
2353;AA134BA;Show him the strength of heavy firepower!
1201;AO007BA;CHANGE THE MAGAZINE!
6746;AU152BD;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
2336;AZ030PA;What? You're not a soldier!
1649;AE108_007;It's the monsters that shoot threads!
6489;AU162AB;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1233;AF008DB;Hasn't noticed us yet.
3688;AA093BC;Thinking that the enemy is in the dark makes me get cold feet.
2684;AA110BC;Being a soldier is awesome. You can get a pension.
781;AM162BA;I'm grateful.
1333;AO009DD;Cool down the system!
1446;AZ032G;Howitzer, fire!
1431;AG005BB;The enemy is coming this way!
7513;AU011DA;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1537;AEX04_725;The Warbarger has arrived.
545;AM084BD;Agreed.
2869;AE143_005;Units near the anchors! Attack the targets right away!
1569;AM067BE;You can't meet those expectations!
5836;AE171_025;Bad news! The mysterious monster, Arcellus, is on a collision course with the combat area!
3070;AE156_012;This is Scout. We've confirmed incoming monsters!
1167;AT207DB;We have to save him!
2377;AE178_018;Why would the aliens invade such a remote base?
3735;AA141BC;Powered exoskeletons were originally a military technology.
2593;AA017BD;I'm lucky today, the bullets won't hit me.
1275;AM074BB;We can't afford that!
1703;AO006DA;Weapon system, reactivate!
1467;AA019BE;I can't possibly die.
1375;AM090DD;I won't forget this.
2101;AE210_011;Neutralize the drones and the monsters.
1375;AY062BC;I shouldn't have done that.
693;AY069BE;Don't worry.
2718;AEX04_620;This is Wing Diver 4. We will start the attack.
847;AE004DC;FIRE!
826;AM021DA;You did it!
2112;AM005V;I will bring you back safely, no worries!
1064;AE040BB;HAVING FUN?!
1149;AN009AB;I'll leave the team to you.
926;AM105DD;Yeah, you're right.
1651;AY009DB;Next time, I'll save you.
844;AZ014I;It's the marker!
1296;AD019DA;Switch to attack mode!
2978;AE206_004;Look at them! We have no chance at all!
961;AK008BD;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
1421;AE201_009;Wing daily and spotted!
2925;AN014DC;What a coincidence. I'm looking for a Commander too.
1435;AA136BD;Leave it to us, Fencers!
559;AH002Y;Evade!
815;AM086W;Whoa!
1941;AL033BB;We took down all enemies!
1440;AF002AC;Be quiet, or we'll be found.
1550;AR027BC;The newcomer got chewed up!
1821;AEX04_393;Mustards are coming out from the eggs!
609;AM031ZA;WRONG
7405;AU011AA;Oh we are the Valiant Infantry We are the Alpha team with passion and camaraderie
1157;AEX04_152;Missile fired!
1009;AY072DA;We'll think of something.
1090;AP020BB;YOU DESERVE IT!
487;AE006AC;SHOOT!
1427;AY004DD;I barely escaped!
1002;AEX04_542;WE'RE SURROUNDED!
2567;AD015DA;I can't wait any longer! Let me shoot!
599;AM067AC;You did it!
7656;AU021DA;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise
3993;AE128_047;This is Bloodhawk, we're low on ammo and fuel, we can only attack once!
2162;AE002_114;Head to the ground surface! Follow me!
1934;AE155_009;Let's save them! Break the web!
852;AO001W;Reload!
1414;AE206_001;Are we the only ones?
3133;AE109_004;First, I will have a nice meal. And...
1757;AN035BD;I've heard everything about you!
2327;AE141_003;We're about to reach the firing range of the base!
2195;AO020BB;Why can't I fire the bullets?
1615;AO006DC;Weapon system, reactivate!
2353;AE201_012;Look, aliens incoming from above!
2671;AE194_028;This is Barga, unable to pursue mothership.
1003;AA080BB;You'll get lost.
728;AM015BA;Nice!
1642;AE105_037;FLYING SAUCERS SPOTTED!
1991;AM090BB;That's what the drill sergeant said, too.
2856;AY012DB;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
3970;AA104BC;I used to be a security guard. Somehow I became a soldier.
7653;AU141BD;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
387;AM052BB;Got it!
3260;AA050DC;For a soldier, the most important thing is the brain.
1361;AD002W;The enemy's approaching!
3579;AE153_023;The location is near the park area. Request for immediate backup!
2018;AE163_054;Ahh! What a chaos!
3800;AE165_009;We can't hang on much longer! Destroy the teleportation ships first!
1458;AL026CA;You're talented in flying.
1048;AA064BB;Why did you enlist?
1565;AC022BB;I'm okay. I'm not shaking.
669;AY063BB;Forgive me.
1010;AB007BE;Hey, time to move!
1021;AN022BE;Nice meeting you!
6821;AE211_103;If we let it get away, all our sacrifices will be for nothing. Please, we have to find a way.
2497;AE105_030;Which freaking country sent those things?
2823;AEX04_093;Fighters will start an air raid. All ground troops, fall back!
1526;AM118BC;It's only your fantasy.
1448;AK004Y;The sensor has detected something!
6350;AE001_004;Now we're at the underground warehouse. This is the only place we can borrow. Let's start our basic trading.
2173;AE127_035;I don't want to be killed by a monster!
1255;AE171_007;All units, move in!
3340;AE155_029;I'm glued to the web, help! Break the web for me!
2855;AA116BE;I finally understand, it's no use to run away.
764;AB001CA;Let's go!
2663;AB009Y;I studied literature. I hate running around.
669;AM036BE;Sounds good.
1568;AE117_056;There are just too many of them!
2919;AE200_005;Fear not! We have the Grim Reaper team as our backup!
2080;AE130_001;The enemy base is coming this way!
4681;AE144_025;I suppose that's the Queen Bee. The flying type cannot multiply without it.
1028;AA021CB;Do you like to fly?
1434;AO008W;The magazine is empty!
1052;AZ013PA;There it is!
605;AE004AB;FIRE!
620;AE160_003;Lights on!
683;AE006CB;SHOOT!
2235;AF004X;Lower your voice or they will find us.
1074;AM013CA;You're doing great!
1722;AZ007K;All bombers, commence attack!
1602;AI006DB;Is the shock absorber overloading?
2355;AE153_013;Nix too! Reload system failed!
1636;AEX04_495;Red-coloured drone sighted!
2731;AA012BC;Actual fighting is much more fun than training.
2340;AE105_048;Wait a minute. I don't like the look of it.
1595;AC002DD;We're ready to engage the fight!
2206;AI014BA;I'll be in trouble if I don't figure it out.
1917;AA089BE;It's my first time in a cave like this.
1036;AE001_024;Let's get to work then.
601;AM045V;What?!
2716;AA015BB;We must crack down on illegal immigrants.
734;AH001BD;WATCH OUT!
1480;AE180_027;The monsters are nearby!
2083;AE159_037;CLIMB UP THIS MOUNTAIN! LET'S GO!
1388;AE138_026;ALIENS APPROACHING!
726;AD005V;It's a game!
1659;AA051AB;Let's enjoy the cave exploration!
906;AS005ED;SAVE ME!
905;AM046CB;Not quite.
1157;AT102DA;IT'S A TRAP!
1665;AA099DA;Flying in the sky is reassuring.
1221;AY065DA;I'll never do that again.
2557;AA015W;To win, we need an operation plan.
3807;AE155_025;I got caught by the threads! Defeat that monster! Quick!
558;AM096DA;No!
1501;AE198_004;Infantry, cover EMC.
1184;AK011BD;Are there more enemies?
638;AA069BA;Do you regret?
1949;AE169_019;Successfully eliminated the king!
1077;AM093BB;This is obvious.
2475;AE005_036;What's that!? I see the body!
1461;AE211_024;The giant is wounded!
1153;AL012ZA;Great! You did it!
1080;AM043Y;It's set on TV!
2408;AT305AA;I'm still alive! It's all thanks to you!
1656;AL010V;Enemy has been eliminated!
1299;AE067BA;So get in my way!
1812;AD013CA;And lock weapon safety devices!
1761;AR005BA;CAPTAIN, HOLD ON!
599;AE100_019;Pretty good.
818;AH013BE;Is it bad?
858;AE179_048;Unlock it!
7744;AU131W;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1812;AK009DD;There seems to be something nearby.
674;AE024AB;LEG SHOT!
1694;AM147BC;You watch too much TV.
1676;AA086DB;I really can't take this.
1426;AD014BD;Still out of range.
2036;AA081DD;I'm really good at flying at night.
1183;AM011Z;Keep up the good work!
1780;AJ007BC;Aren't the rescue teams here yet?
1971;AN002AA;It's our duty to protect civilians.
788;AP006BC;We got one!
3255;AE145_070;So they can move freely in the polluted air. I see.
3254;AR005Z;Forget about the dead! No one else dies today!
1031;AE155_006;DESTROY IT!
2158;AL037DB;I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
1387;AM091DB;Don't spread false info.
752;AM017ZA;Wait a second.
1948;AL029DD;I must prepare for the next battle!
939;AR014BC;One man down!
591;AM159BA;Thank you, sir.
1804;AE167_010;Something is falling from the sky.
1508;AO005X;Reloading cover me
1684;AA030AA;You will win. Correct?
2293;AE147_040;Damn it! This is really getting out of hand.
3883;AE211_104;We've got nothing left. Time to die.
1735;AS002ED;AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!
1638;AE021DB;The sky belongs to me!
3833;AE178_029;Have we finally developed a weapon that can break the ship's armor?
930;AE018BB;I'll back you up!
3003;AF032BD;Attack in silence. That's what the best soldiers do.
1807;AI007DB;Stabilizer, condition four!
1474;AE147_037;How many have been deployed?
2717;AI004W;If I die, contact my insurance company.
1750;AE205_018;Sorry for getting you all into this.
3385;AE188_011;An uncountable amount of flying objects are approaching!
1114;AS003CA;Help!
2074;AL009BB;HYAAH!!!
1860;AB001BC;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
2996;AE183_005;Ah, a winged alien. That's a first.
775;AH001ZA;Take cover!
4223;AE005_015;ETMC costs 100 million dollars to build, and they're useless?
1078;AE037AC;Look around carefully!
1307;AO005BC;Reloading ammo!
1519;AE198_005;Marker Team, spread out ahead!
953;AR016BE;One dead!
1408;AE114_071;Enemy on the left, too!
1851;AE179_031;Enemies! Straight ahead!
987;AF025BE;Can we attack now?
2542;AU002ZA;I got caught in the web. Can't move at all.
2112;AE190_030;The artillery will attack any second.
1860;AA030BA;Following the orders can't be wrong.
3490;AA029W;It's correct to enlist. I'll take down those things.
1160;AH011BD;We'll fix you up later!
950;AM133BC;Yeah, maybe.
2752;AE170_023;There's still others fighting. We can't leave them behind!
3753;AZ007PA;I want to know the enemy's coordinates. Civilian, can you tell me?
1952;AA047W;Take a deep breath, stay calm.
1486;AE104_024;Citizens are being attacked!
793;AY069DB;No worries.
2733;AE211_077;It's only a matter of time till they get the best of us.
1121;AA020AC;Don't let your guard down!
1702;AE056BA;I've seen tons of movies like this!
2472;AE179_005;It's no joke if you slip, cause you'll die.
1418;AM084DB;You're not helping at all.
1014;AE179_018;Ready your weapons!
1615;AL033BE;We took down all the enemies!
1552;AA002EA;AHH! AHH! AHHH!
1637;AJ001BD;We're all gonna die at this rate!
1151;AM138BD;That's also possible!
618;AY051DD;Later.
1642;AEX04_550;We can't hold out without backup!
1322;AE115_026;Attack the aliens!
4871;AE110_038;Attacks on the large flying saucers were ineffective! There's no way mankind can win!
1333;AE135_007;FLYING MONSTERS!
1966;AE061BD;Please hit the target!
705;AM042BB;No problem.
1526;AA058BC;Let's hang out tonight, everyone!
1063;AO007BD;Change the magazine!
2499;AF011DB;Let's sneak up on an unaware enemy and beat it!
1628;AD010BA;Let's do it! Don't miss!
949;AC002Y;I will survive.
1605;AR030BB;The prince got chewed up!
1226;AM029Z;I can assure that!
2024;AL007ZA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1038;AM109BB;Don't be stupid.
1297;AH004DD;I'll go help the injured!
1358;AE004V;SHOOT THEM DEAD!
1293;AJ008X;Is it okay to stay here?
1487;AZ006K;Heading to the air above the target.
984;AE158_007;Come on!
2054;AT309DC;You came. Thank you.
1593;AE107_048;Something's flying over there!
1873;AEX04_029;Enemies from both sides confirmed!
1088;AD002AC;PREPARE TO ENGAGE!
4256;AE119_023;Please reply, we are fighting the red monsters, requesting support!
857;AM037AC;I can't approve!
1087;AL010ZA;Exterminated!
4064;AE147_019;Their armor is too thick! They can still fly even after being hit!
1298;AD020BC;Crap! Too far!
2057;AL008BB;All are blown away!
2100;AE126_003;Destroy the pylons! Let's go!
2402;AE143_073;Crap! We must come up with a countermeasure ASAP!
1357;AE068BE;You regret coming to Earth?!
1284;AY033DD;I'm disappointed.
1188;AM087BA;I knew this was the case.
2516;AE138_057;Wow! What a display!
850;AL020AC;Let's chill out a bit.
2294;AE013AA;REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING! BE BRAVE!
890;AP017BD;WE DID IT!
2657;AE162_012;Directly penetrated the enemy ship's armor!
2305;AA049BB;I am a gambling genius!
1113;AY016DB;Mission complete.
807;AD004AB;Ready your weapon!
992;AY030DC;That was close.
2257;AE143_034;This is why we came all the way to Europe!
1051;AE038AB;Be careful, on the right!
454;AZ021O;BEAM
1737;AEX04_288;Confirmed. Big anchor.
3723;AE142_042;It's like a wire! You'll be chopped into pieces just by touching it!
1277;AA047V;Don't get separated!
1492;AG007Z;Tear the enemy apart!
1399;AE105_040;What is the Air Force doing?
2206;AEX04_624;This is Wing Diver. Target confirmed.
2330;AE139_017;Fine, time my ass! We're winning this!
1580;AJ001BB;We're all gonna die at this rate!
520;AY049BD;Welcome!
2384;AE198_016;Baraka 2 Engaging Hostiles!
2055;AU002V;Can't move! Save me!
3111;AA083DA;This operation... Is the Commander serious?
969;AE183_023;AGAIN?!
1964;AE105_055;No doubt! Those things are aliens!
1988;AT006BB;I'm stuck in the web! Help me!
1786;AK004W;The Scout has spotted the enemy!
614;AM027DC;Yes, sir.
967;AE179_050;Everything normal
1187;AI001AA;MEDIC!
1829;AO010BD;Oh no, I'm out of ammo!
2637;AEX04_273;CONFIRMED. MUTATED FLYING AGGRESSOR.
9911;AE202_073;The same motif has occurred everywhere around the world. An outer space egg came from the sky, and the god who exited the egg created the human civilization!
2693;AE174_036;The short-typed Roy successfully destroyed!
1632;AM213BD;What is going on?!
1690;AA031AA;You get paid to do your job.
971;AS001FD;No!
1265;AH009DC;We have to protect the injured!
3418;AE175_010;Aliens, you said? Were the queens called by the aliens?
1066;AA079BC;Don't get left behind.
1098;AE121_051;Drones incoming!
2152;AT001DA;I can't fly!
835;AG001AB;NOW! SHOOT!
2324;AE153_047;Sorry we're late. We'll take it from here.
728;AQ009BC;I've been hit!
3686;AE210_058;This ship could very well be the enemy's flagship. Destroy it!
2871;AA119BB;I don't want my pension anymore. I want a discharge.
6925;AU152Y;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
1532;AN008BA;You're lucky. I'll help you.
2125;AE057BE;Spend your time on something more meaningful!
643;AC018AA;Plan A!
1693;AD001V;Let's go! Prepare to engage!
2125;AE071BB;NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATES ALLOWED!
3345;AE111_033;All we can do now is defeat the monsters and prevent more damage.
2208;AZ032PB;Hey you, are you just a civilian?
1445;AA030DB;Cruise mode sustained.
3403;AZ024PB;General Headquarters are afraid of this power, so they sealed it.
1455;AE129_046;Take out all surrounding enemies.
2019;AE187_005;I know. Humanity is lost.
4121;AE195_004;They'll keep teleporting monsters to the underground if we don't find them!
1867;AM145BE;You read too many comic books!
1319;AT005BD;DAMN THOSE THREADS!
948;AE002_157;That's ridiculous!
898;AN015DD;Let me help you!
1532;AA093DB;I was an air show performer.
1113;AM206BA;Is that how it is?
1174;AE181_012;Confirm, Dropzone.
392;AB001DB;Go!
2022;AA041AC;Keep going. Don't be afraid of the dark.
632;AE004Y;WATCH THIS!
3216;AE171_033;It's not just big, but tough! What should we do?
4562;AE169_020;Such horrible monsters. Where the hell did those kings come from?
11296;AE202_018;The reason why we're still around, is because the aliens don't have a weapon of mass destruction, like a nuclear bomb. But with their advanced civilization, they should be able to wipe us out, just like that.
2510;AM007AA;Pull the trigger! You can still manage this, right?
1057;AN012DC;I'll follow your order.
999;AE037AB;Look around carefully!
867;AP015BC;We got one!
1161;AY005BA;I owe you my life.
671;AP004BA;Clean hit!
1414;AE141_025;Squad 3, to the back!
3413;AE125_022;This is Delta! We are under the enemy's artillery fire!
903;AM164BC;I appreciate it.
3737;AE208_003;With that size, they must require a huge amount of energy to operate.
900;AK007AC;Keep your guard up!
1504;AE147_030;The mothership is leaving!
982;AD002Z;Raise spear!
2590;AE211_139;Storm One, we'll be counting on you!
1518;AZ003O;Bulge Laser, fully charged.
1572;AA066BE;Do you have any reasons to fight?
2132;AA076DB;I can't believe we have to fly in the dark.
1533;AO015BC;WHERE'S MY MAGAZINE?!
582;AY019BB;Ha ha ha ha!
1837;AE005_005;I'll see you in the next video!
1424;AN014AA;We must work together to win.
967;AM064DC;Ah, that's right.
1559;AE105_049;THEY'RE PREPARING TO ATTACK!
440;AY044BD;Hello!
2007;AE163_051;Again? They're here again!
1555;AP021BA;Nice! One killed!
3365;AE114_072;They're soldiers! Someone is giving them orders!
1319;AL016AA;That seems to be the last one.
1040;AM011X;YOU'RE THE MAN!
3215;AE104_037;Destroy the pylons before they cause more damage!
588;AM037DB;Roger!
1686;AA046DB;Have you been able to contact your family?
1790;AM180BE;Because I have something to protect.
464;AE005_046;Yoroshi!
874;AM187BE;This is freedom!
579;AM029DB;Roger!
1072;AE024BB;Take my bullet!
2029;AE130_022;Drones are coming out from the base!
997;AZ024I;START BOMBING!
1013;AE114_036;What are those?
1077;AO022BC;Is the gun jammed?
2636;AF022BD;Don't do anything before the captain fires.
8536;AE001_008;We're at the bottom of the EDF base. It's currently being used as a warehouse or a hangar. There are also some vehicles here for maintenance.
1663;AM062W;I'll let that one slide.
1384;AA041BC;I can't fall asleep.
1639;AE118_029;Our tanks are under attack!
1716;AE155_001;What are these webs?!
895;AA004FB;Help me!
2591;AE193_005;Move forward! Let's see what that glowing thing is!
691;AM054AC;No way.
1615;AE195_020;I'M LOSING MY MIND!
1145;AEX04_084;Starting Air Raid!
1217;AA079DB;I don't want to walk here.
3620;AE003_019;Ah! It's acid! It's bloody acid!
1329;AI011BC;WE NEED RESCUE!
1654;AC024BB;It's party time!
7108;AU172BB;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
1917;AEX04_722;The war banger has arrived.
2702;AEX02_013;The Calabans are on their way. Try to remain calm.
531;AZ008K;Fire!
4358;AI008CB;If anything happens to me, take care of my family!
571;AT101CB;UGH!
1031;AB001AB;MOVE FORWARD!
1447;AL032DB;Time for a rest.
1023;AEX04_190;Get up from here!
533;AH002CA;Next
942;AE006X;DROP DEAD!
836;AM003AB;Take a deep breath.
658;AE005Z;WATCH ME!
3205;AA022BA;I'm transferring to the logistics division tomorrow. Thanks.
1062;AY065BA;I'll never do that again.
1770;AL047BD;I still have some fight in me.
610;AM172BE;Thanks!
1085;AP004BB;A CLEAN HIT!
603;AY043BC;Good morning.
1209;AM113BA;And you really think so?
2193;AE113_009;Monsters! Exterminate them!
2540;AE002_063;Can anyone operate a powered exoskeleton?
2191;AI002X;It hurts! It's killing me!
850;AM012BA;You're good!
783;AE155_003;Advance!
8872;AE143_072;We've confirmed a swarm of flying types, but we haven't received reports about them dropping teleportation ships yet. They must have been bred by the earlier monsters.
1249;AE204_019;THEY'RE CALLING THE MONSTERS!
1281;AB001AA;MOVE FORWARD!
1662;AE138_045;THE BLACK FENCERS ARE COMING?!
7722;AU111CA;Now we will invade the underground, Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
739;AH015BC;Are you shot?
3563;AA115BB;I only did training, now I am doing the actual fight.
3523;AA022BB;I'm transferring to the logistics division tomorrow. Thanks.
2311;AE135_006;The citizens are in danger! Help us!
303;AY025BD;Hmph!
1567;AE172_010;Shield Bearers Destroyed!
719;AM002AB;STAY CALM!
397;AQ003BA;Ugh!
1230;AA004DB;I'll fly faster next time.
623;AY038DA;Greetings!
1677;AE114_086;ALIEN LANDING SHIPS!
3133;AE118_036;Support the infantry and start individual attack on the enemy.
1189;AF008DA;Hasn't noticed us yet.
2069;AK018BC;Today is such a tiring day!
1155;AS004BD;STOP THAT!
784;AM034CA;That's right.
2612;AA038DC;I think it's because you've gained weight that you can't fly faster.
1079;AE020AC;Take aim at the right!
3406;AT307DB;You almost blew me away along with the web. Be careful.
2450;AE159_006;This is Team Two. Start investigating.
10559;AE149_021;That's a DeRoy B. The legs are featured with some missile-type weapons. Those missiles aren't fast, but they can autocorrect their trajectory and tag along the targets.
8031;AU011DC;Oh, we are the valiant infantry. We are the alpha team with passion and camaraderie.
1891;AE167_004;Teleportation anchor confirmed!
2539;AO010X;Ugh, is it broken? I'm out of ammo!
1080;AM126BA;Don't get it wrong!
1391;AA064DB;Why did you choose to fly?
1016;AN020DA;All yours, Captain!
1148;AE008BA;GO TO HELL!
1811;AD013CB;Unlock weapon safety devices!
2161;AA014CB;Don't over rely on your equipment.
727;AM009W;Good job!
743;AO002CA;Reload!
1858;AF001DB;The anime doesn't seem to notice us.
2372;AA014BD;We don't accept immigrants on this planet.
1746;AT302BD;Thank you so much, comrade!
1837;AE103_044;Look up! Pylons!
1577;AC008AB;Be careful, the enemy is around.
1638;AM089BD;That's what the officer told us, too.
531;AM059BA;No way.
2415;AD015BC;Pretty close, but still out of range.
970;AM119DA;Tell me the rest!
1192;AY020DC;Hahahaha
2134;AE130_018;Heavy tanks, aim at the enemy base!
2278;AE202_017;I just don't understand their strategy.
4376;AE179_001;This passage is only for vehicles. Be careful of the slope, cause you might fall.
8835;AE135_032;We have confirmed a subspecies of the flying type among the group. These dreadful monsters possess immense combat strength. Be extra careful.
1405;AD022DC;Confirm distance with the enemy!
4129;AE170_018;Who knows, maybe those aliens are originally from a planet full of water.
1288;AT105AC;Someone get me a hand!
1014;AJ003Y;No plans at all!
819;AM203BB;Is that so?
1818;AJ003W;Aren't the rescue teams here yet?!
2481;AZ029H;Now you know what the artillery has!
1389;AA035CA;Fly in the dark like a bat!
5909;AE135_017;These monsters will be called flying aggressors from now on. Exterminate them before it gets out of hand.
2895;AA052DC;Don't judge me by my looks. I have a degree.
1059;AD001Y;Not quite in range.
1577;AM005CA;We will die if we don't fight!
2169;AL018X;Now our job is over, isn't it?
1329;AE103_004;Something is falling!
2352;AE112_043;Let's finish what the Air Force failed to do!
3843;AA020BC;I've managed to survive this long. How can I die now?
4496;AE122_003;I shot down seven drones by myself. I'm gonna break my record today.
934;AM066X;Is that so?
1267;AC017DA;Switch to burst mode!
9051;AE110_045;Obviously the flying saucers are dropping monsters that are larger than their own mass. They are probably equipped with the same teleportation device used by the pylons.
1306;AM089DB;Do you have a screw loose?
4095;AA108BB;I have always wanted to be a soldier. Now my dream comes true.
1417;AR006AA;Hold on! Get up!
633;AE007Z;DIE!
2498;AE121_053;THE GIANT CANNONS ARE ACTIVATING!
1476;AC006AA;Remove this safety device.
857;AC008DC;It's our turn.
861;AL016BD;We won!
1474;AO016BC;WHERE ARE MY BULLETS?!
4751;AE211_106;Number of deployable units. Zero. It's over.
1234;AM054BE;I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS!
1123;AM129BA;CONFIRM ONCE AGAIN!
1395;AE021BE;THIS WEAPON IS EFFECTIVE!
1421;AC004BA;Please leave it to me next time.
3380;AE002_037;Take the pathway for AFVs. Beware of the slope.
1081;AM088BD;THAT'S the truth.
1219;AA002FD;NOOOOO!
1027;AM005DC;I'll protect you all!
2345;AE211_141;Go for it! Storm one!
818;AH006BE;I'll back you up!
3402;AZ035H;The bombing is over, I'm gonna go take a shower.
1767;AE166_017;Never seen this kind of armor before.
1371;AL003V;E D F
1540;AY077DC;Hey, we're buddies!
1984;AJ011BB;Where is the replacement commander?
5211;AE202_035;The submarine carrier Siren was attacked by Mother Ship Number Six. We've lost all contact.
1625;AO008DA;Transfer power to weapons!
2723;AA014AB;Fight to the end, no matter what. That's EDF.
2342;AA044X;We are underground explorers. Hooray!
1799;AO026BB;Reloading! I don't need backup!
2030;AS001DA;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1103;AE181_016;Board the bar-ga!
3266;AA008W;Being a soldier is great. It's an honorable job.
1832;AA033ZA;The sky belongs to us.
3401;AE003_033;It was safer underground! We should have stayed down there!
343;AP003BD;SHIT!
3697;AA001DD;I train harder than anyone else, so I'll be fine. No doubt.
6908;AU132AC;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
2972;AA130BE;Thanks to the powered exoskeleton, it feels weightless.
1534;AE068BC;YOU REGRET COMING TO EARTH?!
1921;AZ007H;Tell everyone we're going to attack!
1644;AA063BC;How about singing a song?
1316;AM110BD;That couldn't be true!
6360;AE121_033;I can't believe they can deploy entire bases. Those aliens certainly came prepared.
1120;AY028DA;That's funny!
1536;AEX04_079;Starting air raid!
1676;AA018BE;Bullets can never hit me!
1513;AEX04_292;Confirmed, DeRoy.
2738;AA119BA;I don't want my pension anymore, I want a discharge!
2167;AE205_004;The rescue team is on its way. Hang in there.
925;AN029DA;Is it really you?
1584;AN030DD;You're really famous!
1655;AM182BC;This is for my family.
1592;AS016BE;Take down this guy!
1774;AE022DB;I'm the queen of the sky!
1296;AY034DC;Sigh...
1487;AM110DD;You're a genius!
4135;AE194_020;But we would have been here sooner if we hadn't had to transport this big fella.
1064;AT005AB;Target that thing!
7498;AU171X;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt. On the front we are the brave heroes that we fight on.
3860;AA026W;I've always wanted to be a General, and I haven't given up, even now.
1542;AA095BC;Are giant creatures edible?
1137;AK001W;We have company!
1054;AM138DA;Because I'm a fighter.
2470;AN006AC;It's also our job to protect brave civilians.
3017;AE146_017;This is Rescue Team A, engaging the aliens!
2261;AA049DC;I used to be the best pilot in the world.
1051;AE146_029;Let's get out of here!
2966;AA017BB;I'm lucky today! The bullets won't hit me!
1298;AM002Y;I'll never leave you behind!
1510;AM150DA;Do you need any reasons to fly?
1051;AM063AA;You did a great job.
1209;AG009DD;The enemy is coming!
773;AB004DA;Let's move!
1378;AE197_020;Big anchor! Confirmed!
444;AY051DA;Later.
7051;AU012AA;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold and raise your guns
2270;AE143_026;Destroy the teleportation anchors!
1143;AE176_059;Time to get to work!
1144;AS012BE;Let me down!
1125;AM037AA;I can't approve!
2516;AN032BE;I'm so happy that I can fight together with a hero!
1858;AS005DB;Let me down!
2415;AA002W;I never imagined the situation would be like this.
1443;AE189_001;Exterminate the Araneas!
662;AM039CA;That's right!
916;AN018DB;Let's go together!
1673;AEX04_394;They're coming out from the eggs!
1238;AE141_053;Where is it going?!
972;AE030AB;Shoot at the left!
2522;AE211_041;There is a halo behind that guy!
1915;AA114BD;Isn't this operation kind of messy?
2334;AT303BE;You destroyed the web? I'm impressed!
595;AM026V;NO!
1353;AM081X;I don't want to answer that.
970;AR016DA;Someone fell!
1740;AN013AA;Here you are. Leave it to you, then.
2676;AA009BC;It's just pulling the trigger, piece of cake.
901;AM135DB;Thanks for the help!
2012;AA082BB;I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.
435;AH001CA;Dodge!
851;AE028AC;Who's gonna kill it?
1476;AT101CA;AHHH!
1798;AF006DD;Let's draw closer to the enemy.
647;AM034BD;Understood.
946;AS012BB;Let me down!
2672;AE188_001;Flying objects approaching. Get ready for combat.
3827;AZ056G;Aren't you a civilian? Why would you know there are quest code for air strikes?
515;AP004DA;Got it!
4606;AE143_041;The bigger the anchor, the more monsters can be teleported! Destroy them!
2319;AEX04_535;A GIGANTIC MONSTER IS INCOMING!
1748;AE158_028;Destroy all shield bearers!
412;AE001CB;HUH?!
1631;AA008AC;Kick out those illegal intruders!
2499;AL023DC;I'll take the opportunity to check my system now.
2328;AT207BA;Help your allies! Destroy the web!
1425;AY077BB;Hey, we're buddies!
6350;AE003_007;The only functioning powered exoskeleton is Yoda II. Yoda II, protect all activated powered exoskeletons.
940;AM027Z;That's for sure!
1123;AE030AA;SHOOT AT THE LEFT!
2377;AE121_024;It's the aliens with monsters!
1527;AQ014BC;Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
1707;AF017BA;Lower your voice or they'll find us!
1145;AE161_019;They're rolling this way!
1258;AD008ZA;Output, max.
1513;AR003AA;Damn! Man down!
3158;AE143_031;Those anchors will put everyone at risk! Destroy them!
790;AM162BB;I'm grateful.
1347;AC010BE;And we'll take down the enemies.
2251;AE141_027;Taliban support vehicle. Pick up the injured.
1630;AA003BB;My shooting skills are good.
1196;AM099DD;That's not true!
1519;AA062BA;Wanna play a wordchain game?
1782;AE003_034;It's much more dangerous on the surface!
1568;AE026X;I'LL MAKE YOU MIXED MEAT!
1786;AN007Z;Storm One, take it away!
613;AD024DB;Ready!
6746;AU032AC;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
1471;AE132_017;Fire at the monsters!
1466;AE109_011;Now this is really bad!
2623;AT101AB;Damn! I can't move!
2821;AE063BE;It's too strong! That's not what I was told!
2387;AM196BC;I did it after listening to others' opinions.
326;AY023BD;Mm-hmm.
773;AN018DC;Let's go together.
1126;AK008AA;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
937;AZ010PA;CONFIRMED!
577;AR001BC;CAPTAIN!
9328;AE106_010;The drones in this area are all in alert mode. Don't fight all the drones at once. Lure a few of them each time, and then destroy them one by one.
1377;AI022BE;No way I'll die!
979;AD001AB;Prepare to shoot!
755;AN002BB;I'll back you up.
840;AM023W;Affirmative!
988;AE122_018;YOU'RE TALENTED!
2129;AEX04_313;Confirm gigantic urgentness.
1304;AE168_017;I have better vision now!
717;AY038DB;Greetings.
617;AM066AA;Thank you!
1267;AM151BE;Agreed! Agreed!
1440;AN006Y;I'll cover you, Storm One!
1273;AN034BD;I know who you are!
1911;AE205_011;Right side, they're coming from the right!
1109;AL013BA;Exterminated!
1872;AK004V;A new type of enemy is here!
1989;AN023AB;I'm surprised to meet our ace here.
6980;AE163_057;We have sent out the recovery team. They will collect biological samples at the scene. All units retreat.
1246;AM055BD;The answer is yes.
1746;AN005BD;I have no choice. I'll go with you.
1611;AE003_037;INCOMING MONSTERS!
913;AQ008BA;I'VE BEEN SHOT!
1418;AC026DD;Countdown to the battle!
1295;AE178_034;What are you, really?
1125;AL016X;Time for a rest!
1221;AQ011BE;The armor's damaged!
2067;AT002Y;I can't get out! Somebody help!
2218;AE198_015;Bargain team, commence assault.
2859;AE122_008;Crap! It's got too much firepower!
1127;AM086BA;So, that's how it is.
1292;AE003DB;Roar!
1018;AA033BA;Come back alive!
1148;AG010BE;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
943;AB002BE;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
1182;AI012BD;SO UNLUCKY!
1082;AM003DD;I'll go save you!
1924;AK015BE;Looks like our job is not finished yet!
1016;AM020ZA;I can't allow that!
2312;AE121_031;The air strike didn't seem to work either.
5547;AE198_023;Is bargain seven something's wrong with my right foot what i mean is bargain's right foot
2014;AE005_029;Let's go outside!
1367;AE003BD;YEAH!
2413;AE128_036;Look over there! The enemy artillery unit!
1704;AA002FC;NOOOOOO!
896;AA018AA;Reload now.
1862;AE200_026;We've eliminated the shield bearers!
3059;AA044V;Take it easy, your eyes will get used to the dark.
2514;AI009AA;Let's get this job done quickly.
1279;AE159_035;Approach their nest!
3628;AE178_017;HOW DARE YOU COME TO MY HOUSE? I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S THE BOSS!
2493;AE022BA;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
2094;AA027BC;I start to feel hungry.
1250;AY008BB;I'm so grateful.
1467;AE120_014;They're calling monsters!
5032;AE150_035;We'll finish it when we change to that new weapon, but first, we need to stay alive!
1970;AF027BA;Are we launching the surprise attack or not?
1436;AR006BB;Captain, please reply!
879;AN019DB;Take me with you.
1667;AE114_027;Humanoid aliens?
1695;AEX04_454;IT'S REFLECTING OUR BULLETS!
1069;AA041BE;I can't fall asleep.
3720;AE195_027;I saw a gigantic monster! It was a king!
1796;AJ014BC;Who is our superior officer?
1495;AE141_014;Attack the base's cannons!
675;AM030DB;Understood.
1535;AK006BC;The scout has spotted the enemy!
1598;AA003BA;My shooting skills are good!
2920;AA100BA;I'm unlucky. I'll certainly-
2251;AK005V;The sensor is responding! Let's go!
663;AM068DC;Of course.
1813;AE210_133;The command ship has been destroyed!
540;AE027BD;BRING IT!
2119;AE118_027;Support the infantry and protect the tanks!
1084;AL006BA;WE DID IT!
1204;AE181_015;Barga initiated!
3313;AEX04_677;Team Cougar! Commence operation! Eliminate the enemy!
1881;AE179_045;Guess we won't die for nothin'!
787;AN027DB;My pleasure.
1081;AE047BC;I see our chance!
6820;AU022CB;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
1564;AE207_020;IT'S A TELEPORTATION ANCHOR!
1413;AE197_004;IT'S COMING DOWN!
855;AM069BC;Impossible!
1401;AA030DC;Cruise mode sustained.
868;AM078AB;How can that be?
3306;AE146_021;We can't hold any longer! Retreat! RETREAT!
1547;AD005BB;Shoot them once they're in range!
1828;AF008AC;Get prepared before the enemy sees us.
1922;AA102BB;Tell my family I fought bravely.
2320;AD006X;Wait, let me estimate the distance.
1638;AA037BE;Be serious sometimes!
4139;AEX04_426;This is Scout. Confirmed large amount of aggressive alien species beta.
910;AK001DC;Enemy nearby!
3092;AA022Y;If I can't stay alive, then no thanks.
2187;AE125_025;We can't approach because of the artillery fire!
725;AM048BC;Understood
428;AY052BA;Bye-bye.
2422;AA015DB;With this aerial unit, monsters are nothing.
1858;AF001V;Calm down, now is the chance.
3329;AE159_011;It's unusual to see the flying aggressors move in flocks.
5833;AZ032I;Are you sure it's okay? No! This is artillery! Bombing to the requested site is complete!
768;AM106DA;I know.
2401;AA039DC;If you want to fly faster, lose some weight.
4090;AA113BB;I heard about the war situation. EDF has a commanding lead.
3153;AE198_026;Barga 3! I was hit! But I can still keep it up!
5999;AZ008PA;I'll keep your secret for you, but in return, you have to tell me the enemy's position.
3147;AA055DB;A pilot who is too beautiful to look at. That's me.
3088;AE141_054;Don't let it escape! Launch an airstrike to destroy the base!
1209;AN034BC;I know who you are!
1056;AB007V;GO! GO!
1355;AK004Z;We've got a new job to do!
1228;AA059AA;What a huge cave.
1494;AE168_043;Annihilate all monsters!
809;AY068BC;It's alright.
1479;AL024BC;Victory is ours!
1037;AZ012G;Target confirmed.
10573;AEX02_034;I see aliens walking down our streets. The urban area is not safe anymore. Everybody is in hiding, but we don't know what to do. Please help us.
771;AM013DA;Not bad!
2353;AT309BE;Thanks to the hero that came to my rescue!
619;AY049DB;Welcome.
1890;AL001DB;Hwaaaah!
1370;AE023BC;EAT THE BULLET!
805;AM042AC;I'll think about it.
643;AE100_014;Good!
2607;AE211_120;I knew no one could have survived this.
2042;AN001W;It's okay now. I'll protect you.
851;AY003BA;Let me thank you.
1114;AM102BD;That's what we were taught!
1400;AH027BE;I'll protect you, Captain!
1113;AY069DD;No worries!
1091;AM061DA;Yeah, probably.
1516;AZ011L;Cruise missile, fire!
1918;AK012BE;I've got a bad feeling about this.
2125;AA075DC;So this is the underground wind.
931;AG002BA;They found us!
8126;AE202_031;Now they need to take time to set up base, since the submarine carriers are causing them trouble. We need to take advantage of this opportunity.
1783;AZ003PB;System repair complete.
1839;AEX03_003;THERE ARE MONSTERS ON THE WEBS!
8961;AE149_006;These robots are autonomous, just like the drones. Now they're in standby mode. Once being attacked, they will switch to battle mode.
1061;AZ002K;Target confirmed.
1945;AT110DB;Ugh, break the web!
6773;AU122V;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens
4164;AE176_056;This is Snick's one, so there, Tarkolus. Leave it to us!
907;AE157_027;What do you mean?
6744;AE157_020;A device that creates a light barrier. The barrier will spread out like a dome and block out all attacks.
3951;AE110_006;The Air Force will shoot down the flying saucers. They will start the attack soon.
981;AE133_028;I was right!
991;AM119DB;Tell me the rest!
1330;AS007BE;Somebody help me!
6781;AU172V;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
5226;AE104_031;Based on the falling trajectories of the pylons, we've determined the location of the gigantic ship.
1462;AF005X;It's not too late to get back.
2212;AN019AA;I don't feel like it, but I will obey.
1837;AE161_023;I feel like a bowling pin right now!
2002;AS001BC;AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2380;AEX04_367;CONFIRMED! MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ARCHILLIS!
1405;AN010DA;I'll be in charge of protecting you.
1750;AE109_009;They're coming from all directions!
2281;AA125BD;Poor enemy, they have to fight us!
1289;AE024W;BE CAREFUL ON THE RIGHT!
1939;AE190_047;A large group of monsters has appeared!
1260;AH008DC;Report to the medical center!
1372;AH002X;Hey, I'll back you up.
1030;AD001BD;The enemy is here!
890;AM052DD;No way!
1123;AE132_003;I can't see the bottom!
1198;AR003BD;Captain got chewed up!
1048;AZ020G;Request accepted.
2492;AL010DB;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1401;AF009BE;Captain, let's attack now!
936;AO032BE;Reload bullets!
2003;AA024DD;Plasma Drive, Condition 1
2682;AZ026O;Bulge laser. Initiating emergency cool-down.
556;AQ001V;AHHH!
2834;AI001V;Ugh, I'm okay. No worries.
744;AL012X;GOSH!
2519;AE116_028;Quit whining and start shooting! Let's go!
6817;AE136_013;Why would two mysterious monsters show up at the same time and place? Do they attract each other?
1695;AE178_020;Teleportation ships are coming!
3303;AEX03_006;Aranea Threads can hit from distance. Never turn your back on them.
2585;AA015BD;We must crack down on illegal immigrants.
7657;AU031X;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1617;AE123_008;But the civilians aren't- ugh
1152;AE026AB;Let's take it down!
1747;AE149_016;There's something falling from the sky!
2061;AE113_005;Newbie! Time to show your courage!
5051;AE103_042;It seems that it was dropped from the giant flying saucer. We don't know any more details other than that.
1406;AM149BA;THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE!
2129;AA044AB;We must annihilate all enemies underground!
2590;AE210_040;W-what the hell is going on?!
981;AM037W;Not possible!
6708;AE149_007;The city will be in ruins once this many robots start their invasion. There's no time for the Air Force. Let's do it.
2398;AT106DA;I'm not able to move at all!
1337;AA006DD;Flying is my job.
413;AM210BA;WHOA!
1773;AL045BC;Boot camp is nothing like this!
788;AO003ZA;Reload!
1189;AE046BE;Attack your left!
2648;AL014AC;That's the last one. Extermination complete.
1314;AA007DA;The wind is refreshing.
2113;AE104_018;Looks like it's not safe here either.
4118;AE005_007;Thank you very much for watching, and I'll see you next time!
2040;AE194_004;The mothership is deploying drones!
1234;AA010BE;I'm not trained for this!
2409;AN019AB;I don't feel like it, but I'll obey.
1210;AR021BD;Someone got killed!
1907;AC013AA;Positive enemy reaction. Stay sharp.
3044;AE160_001;Commence operation. Don't underestimate them.
1498;AJ016BD;WE NEED A CAPTAIN!
1782;AD023DA;Stabilizer, max out!
1963;AE128_062;They look very much alive!
2076;AA047BD;I can make the best dishes in the world.
2001;AS006BA;SOMEBODY HELP!
1685;AZ038G;Ballistic missile, fire!
1893;AE174_010;Nick Spore, Master Arm On.
4609;AE004_075;I won't allow any unlawful occupation, even if you are aliens!
7928;AU171BD;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
373;AM038AC;NO!
1156;AE011DA;Can you keep up with me?
2874;AA040V;Don't just use your eyes, try to feel their presence!
3566;AE131_046;What a nightmare! I can't believe we're going to fight in a place like this!
650;AM026Y;Understood!
1834;AE150_019;Teleportation ship is destroyed!
1323;AS002BE;GAAAAAHHH!
1084;AR014DA;One diver died!
1544;AE067BB;So get in my way!
1166;AO010AA;Cartridge change!
2926;AE138_064;And the scale is several times larger than we've ever dealt with.
2181;AT102BE;I'm tangled in the threads and can't move!
1204;AG003ZA;Prepare for battle!
799;AE176_032;Advance!
867;AL006BD;We did it!
409;AM056BE;Yes!
3218;AE141_097;Let's just say, there's no second chance if we lose.
2125;AA107BA;Because I left the security company to enlist.
722;AM059BB;No way!
6828;AU172DD;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends We will storm ahead until the end
678;AM063BA;Can't do.
1510;AE202_010;New breed confirmed!
1455;AO028BC;Swap the magazine!
2184;AC019DB;See if you can handle the attack from the sky!
1797;AE145_064;Fall back, or we'll all die!
8688;AE211_113;When a powerful alien entity attacks, the lesser organism will be extinguished. Maybe that's the rule of the universe.
1716;AA061DD;Why would you become a pilot?
4939;AE143_011;Ask the soldiers to spread so they won't get hit by the fallen anchors! There's nothing else we can do!
3028;AE004_033;Just like us, they have limbs, a head and two eyes!
2128;AE103_021;Does that mean we're at war with some country?
2279;AE003_010;Ahhhhhhh!
1203;AE117_055;That's a monster nest!
2883;AS002DD;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
662;AG003DA;Attack!
1173;AG005DB;The enemy's sauce!
2081;AA056BD;I'll treat you to a thickly cut steak.
1150;AD010DB;Ready to take off!
565;AM035W;NO!
926;AM021Z;Cut it out!
909;AM213BC;What's going on?
2028;AA025BA;I'll barbecue with my kids on the weekend!
975;AE121_028;Attack the base!
1535;AA057BD;I'll give you something good later.
1074;AM002X;HOLD ON BUDDY!
1232;AB006W;HEY! TIME TO MOVE!
1790;AM004V;The medic will check on your wound later!
1726;AT204BC;Don't give up! I'm coming to save you!
1288;AI001DD;The wings are abnormal?!
3750;AE170_029;Are you looking for the railgun? It's over there if I remember correctly.
1024;AA044BE;Do you need support?
1157;AH002ZA;EVADE THE ATTACK!
1729;AE065BD;RAAAGH!
1592;AM127BE;Look carefully, you're wrong!
1592;AM008DB;Get up and keep fighting!
2227;AF023BA;When the captain fires, we fire together.
1305;AL030BC;We're invincible!
791;AE043BB;Go for the right!
2262;AA029BA;Believe in the headquarters and we will win.
1296;AF005BD;The enemy didn't see us!
3116;AZ032PA;Hey you! Are you just a civilian?
1770;AE148_002;Fireballs are coming down!
1698;AD001DC;The enemy is outside the range!
833;AB004Z;ON THE DOUBLE
687;AM019Z;Negative.
1091;AL036BC;It's finally over.
1638;AE163_015;Huh? What do they want?
2188;AE112_036;SHOOT DOWN THE TELEPORTATION SHIPS!
2139;AR018DC;Ah! Someone got chewed up!
1233;AY055DD;I'm going to sleep.
1539;AO008DC;Transfer power to weapons!
1814;AA114BA;Isn't this operation kinda messy?
2040;AE012AA;Don't hesitate! Just pull the trigger!
1001;AM037AB;I can't improve!
1115;AM164DD;What's going on?
1765;AG002DA;Let the flying combat begin!
7937;AE146_056;To all units in combat, the enemy main force has left this area, now continue to attack and recover the city.
5355;AE139_018;Impressive! It would have never crossed their minds that the few of us can make them pay like this.
1339;AL004DB;E-D-E-F!
2490;AE205_017;We're deep inside enemy lines. Be prepared.
559;AY053BD;See ya!
1484;AE157_001;The aliens should be ahead!
11504;AE115_006;When engaging aliens, we will have a better advantage in buildings and other locations that will provide cover. If we're attacked, we can hide and move to the enemy's blind spot for a counter-attack.
3487;AE147_023;This is Scout! The mothership is dropping off new type drones!
1499;AE211_045;No!
1747;AEX04_330;CONFIRMED! FLYING AGGRESSOR!
1195;AM143BD;Can we change the subject?
2764;AEX04_571;This is Ranger 1-6, we are in position.
1561;AI008AA;There are cracks in my armor!
2081;AC010AA;The enemy is around. The battle will soon begin.
3488;AZ007J;This is Bummer. It's okay if you're a civilian. Help us, please.
1225;AE061BB;Please hit the target!
858;AE007AA;ATTACK!
1127;AY030DB;That was close!
587;AM155DD;Really?
1664;AEX04_521;Teleportation ships!
942;AE106_007;Tell me how.
1823;AE138_048;Railguns are about to arrive.
1354;AM008DC;Get up and keep fighting!
1765;AE128_001;Commence Operation Iron Wall!
1097;AE178_016;ALIENS APPROACHING!
3028;AM011DA;We must continue to fly until all enemies are knocked down!
674;AM013DC;Not bad.
1360;AA010DB;My body feels light today.
6699;AU022AB;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
1087;AR019BA;ONE MAN DOWN!
1663;AI001BD;Crap! My armor is...
2206;AM196BE;I did it after listening to others' opinions.
1950;AN025DD;Wing Divers will secure your safety.
568;AY043DA;Good morning.
3170;AD008V;Not close enough! Let's wait for the enemy to get in range first!
3065;AE131_035;Maybe the monsters can only build their nest in certain places.
772;AM047DA;I refuse.
927;AM023AA;That's amazing!
480;AM161BC;Thank you.
2813;AE117_061;I didn't expect so many enemies inside.
809;AQ006DC;I'm dropping!
2175;AE134_009;Shoot the enemy ships down! I'll cover you!
3016;AE192_015;Fight with everything you have! Kill them monsters!
1642;AB014DB;I don't want to run anymore!
553;AK011DA;Again?
1122;AR014BD;One man down!
2445;AE105_044;Please prioritise intelligence collection.
3101;AE115_039;Newbie, your bravery is impressive. Well done.
1586;AE138_035;Grim Reaper, charging in!
1139;AM136DC;Thank you so much!
1487;AE135_003;PROTECT THE CIVILIANS!
1852;AO027BD;Reload! No need to cover me!
1129;AEX04_120;Hit Confirmed!
926;AE179_008;What's that?
1152;AE205_019;Monsters incoming!
1130;AJ009Y;This can't go on!
374;AZ025G;SHOOT
1619;AA066AB;Don't let Rangers beat us to it!
702;AM020BA;Good job!
964;AM077DA;That's what I heard!
2033;AA061AA;Show them the power of heavy weapons.
1327;AR005DD;The captain is gone!
2800;AF032BA;Attack in silence. That's what the best soldiers do.
1507;AE166_009;Aliens! Three to go!
1140;AK001BC;CONFIRM THE ENEMY!
522;AY051BD;Later!
1795;AP021BB;Nice! One killed!
1912;AI015BB;Damn! I feel dizzy!
2690;AA005EB;Someone! Save me!
1086;AEX04_695;Dispatching tanks.
877;AC005BD;Enemy spotted.
1957;AA100DB;I'll never get defeated by monsters.
1403;AE002_085;FIRE AT WILL!
1094;AE007AB;ATTACK!
4926;AE137_019;It's too difficult to destroy the mobile base. Take down the teleportation ships first.
782;AM106BD;WRONG
1679;AA039AC;We have good chances, so we'll win!
939;AP002DA;One killed!
908;AL039BC;Can I get a medal?
471;AM055CB;Huh?
769;AM034AA;No, wait.
2942;AE164_006;So the ship's weak points must be down there.
373;AM028DA;Yeah!
1281;AE119_045;MORE ARE STILL COMING!
2279;AT304BC;Who destroyed the net? I must thank him.
2342;AE114_064;The enemies are attacking us from the side!
2297;AT305BD;I'm free! It's all thanks to you.
1049;AD009BA;They're coming this way!
2861;AE118_023;How can a creature make an attack like that?
3118;AA105BD;I had done the training for a guard but not for a soldier.
850;AB002ZA;Follow me!
839;AA111BE;Do you like the army?
1955;AD019BD;Come here, I'll teach you a lesson.
6134;AE198_012;Barga want to all units. Barga is unarmed, melee only. Fire away and don't let us slow you down.
2063;AA099BD;If only I can make it back alive!
5884;AE211_102;Damn it! What's the point of destroying the command ship if we cannot defeat that thing?
2316;AE210_130;This might actually work! Keep firing!
1698;AF001BC;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
1084;AE200_010;GET THEM ALL!
656;AY066DC;My bad.
3849;AE129_027;This is the demolition team! Please take down the teleportation chips quickly!
3496;AEX04_424;Those threads are dangerous! You won't be able to move if you get hit!
1741;AM006AB;It's no big deal! Keep fighting!
1508;AE121_007;Head toward the Alien Outpost!
2087;AE141_102;We can only pray for victory.
1538;AE198_084;I don't care! Just hurry up!
971;AY028DD;That's funny!
1104;AE117_022;Aliens
4580;AE164_032;You hardly see any familiar faces at war. Most of us don't last long.
2363;AA016CB;Always check how much power you have left.
952;AL007CB;We made it!
1316;AG006AA;BATTLE BEGINS!
2882;AE105_069;Show them the power of powered exoskeletons!
1077;AB003BE;MOVE FORWARD!
1047;AM012W;I understand, sir.
1146;AL020CA;Look after the patients!
2997;AE153_044;Next one! SEVERELY DAMAGED! AAAAAAAAAAAH!
1506;AEX04_509;BATTLE ROBOTS!
2194;AE190_042;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
445;AM029BC;Got it.
7534;AU121AB;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucers, shooting down our foe
1328;AA109BA;Being a soldier is my duty.
3362;AEX04_730;Thanks for the rescue! By the way, where's the main troop?
416;AM058CA;WHAT?!
868;AQ001DA;No!
1235;AR020DA;I'll save the fallen one!
1388;AA001EB;AHHHHHHH!
3030;AE150_026;The mysterious monster is about to pass this area.
673;AEX04_057;Two more.
4941;AE005_039;Don't forget to subscribe to EMC for more videos!
1500;AM135BC;Yeah, you can see that.
1013;AY008BE;I'm so grateful.
1701;AD002DA;Beyond weapon effective range!
2274;AF007AB;The enemy is too careless, now is the best timing.
1922;AI008DB;Shock absorber, condition four.
1848;AI004BE;I can still fight! Gah!
2458;AY011BA;EDF doesn't leave men behind. Ever.
6724;AU032DD;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
7213;AU172DB;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends We will storm ahead until the end
5920;AE115_038;All attempts have utterly failed. The entire negotiation team has been killed.
1304;AE132_012;This way! Catch up!
1452;AL021BC;YA-HOO!
883;AY023BA;Hahaha
2321;AE211_026;It's regenerating its body parts.
599;AE177_044;Fire!
1687;AE153_019;LANDING SHIPS ARE APPROACHING!
1261;AM078BA;Let's talk about it later!
1399;AM137BC;No one is complaining.
3300;AE153_025;X4 here. I'm isolated. Requesting support!
687;AM073X;Thanks.
2280;AM120BE;You better be sure before you say anything.
1274;AY074BC;This'll work fine.
3266;AEX04_427;A new variant! Their bodies look like plated armor!
616;AM046X;Correct!
2570;AL003DB;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1344;AB001BB;RAAAGH!
7779;AU131DA;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
7040;AE202_001;We're engaging species, Gamma! Our rifles are no use against them! They're stronger than we thought!
1293;AJ009DC;We must complete the mission!
650;AE163_043;On the way!
1119;AC001BD;Ready for battle!
1021;AD001CB;Prepare to fly!
2996;AE179_002;It's steep here, as usual.
1774;AN002ZA;Hey rookie, can you manage it?
2158;AE157_005;Confirmed to be alien landing ships!
1060;AP018BB;Did you see that?!
1128;AE104_030;Thank you for the support.
1140;AN012DB;I'll follow your order.
1819;AF005DD;Asking for permission to attack!
2669;AA082DD;I should have worked harder on my night flight training.
1429;AE204_013;Scout team joining the fight!
850;AM055AA;Cut it out!
1608;AM010W;You've been practicing, haven't you?
1163;AO009DA;Cool down the system!
1024;AA036BE;Do your best!
564;AM161BD;Thank you!
1759;AG007DC;The enemy's coming at us full throttle!
559;AB004W;GO!
561;AE158_019;DIVE!
1882;AE002_150;Why didn't the rescue teams come?
1367;AK004BD;The sensor shows something!
3272;AE106_002;This is Rabbit. We're surrounded by flying saucers and can't move!
1274;AG003BC;The enemy is moving!
1600;AC012DB;Weapon system, activate.
600;AM060DD;Correct.
1099;AE024BE;Take my bullet!
5218;AA133BC;With a powered exoskeleton, even weak men can be strong, but you must train yourself.
1701;AZ008Q;Civilian, tell me where is safe.
3614;AE107_009;Beware of the thread! Once you get tangled, you can't move!
1719;AI010DC;Ah! My wounds!
1066;AE118_003;Attack the monsters!
1178;AH027BC;I'll protect you, Captain.
2445;AA031BC;Our superiors' operation plans are perfect.
3469;AT307DC;You almost blew me away along with the web. Be careful.
1328;AM079DD;That's not true!
1159;AE117_058;They're not letting us in!
936;AB005BD;I'll follow you!
3132;AA140BD;Because the powered exoskeletons were developed by the military.
1302;AR008AB;Cover the ones down!
1984;AA068BD;Why did you take a mission like this?
1106;AO009DB;Cool down the system!
2023;AF022BC;Don't do anything before the captain fires.
1529;AT111BB;DESTROY THE WEB!
1750;AL049BC;Time to find the next enemy!
2550;AE153_021;The aliens are descending! Right in front of us!
1076;AO015BE;Where's my magazine?!
1151;AEX04_207;DEFEND BARGA!
577;AM068DA;Of course.
1621;AS002EE;ARGHHHHHHH!!!
2033;AE211_129;Storm One, you gave us hope!
1149;AY040DD;At your service!
746;AE017DD;HIGHER!
818;AB008DA;HA!
1521;AL013W;The enemies are wiped out!
1728;AE100_010;H-how is this possible?!
1734;AE002_001;Let's move. Follow me.
1105;AG011BE;The enemy is here!
381;AM040BE;Yes!
697;AE211_097;DAMN IT!
1539;AL047BC;I still have some fight in me!
3753;AE199_010;They are like a mutated form of aggressive alien species alpha.
1410;AJ012BB;Where's the new commander?
2089;AE151_013;IT'S BARBECUE TIME!
2177;AEX04_529;Monster teleportation device found!
449;AM211BB;WHAT?!
1743;AL045BA;Boot camp is nothing like this.
1992;AEX04_517;Teleportation anchors incoming!
889;AE181_013;Dropping Barca.
1534;AL003AC;E-D-F!
1513;AR005CA;Ugh! My man!
2392;AE147_034;The enemy is dispatching a new type of weapon.
799;AM194BE;Because I like it.
2463;AEX04_567;This is Ranger 6, target located.
4416;AE110_036;If we can't shoot down the large flying saucers, the monsters will keep multiplying!
837;AE002_013;Here we are.
354;AY044BC;Hello.
3690;AE174_022;The long-legged robot has got so many cannons mounted to its body!
1091;AE029AA;SHOOT AT THE RIGHT!
502;AY037DC;Hi
341;AM079BA;Yeah.
6800;AE211_118;There's... nothing we can throw at these aliens. Is... is this the end?
2088;AA074DA;I've never been trained to fly underground.
835;AM025CA;I can't approve.
977;AE011AA;Stay strong.
650;AM034BC;Understood
1569;AR002X;Come on, hang in there!
767;AN002BD;I'll back you up.
1174;AL021BE;Yahoo!
1173;AY075DD;I'm having fun!
2103;AS009BE;I'M OVER HERE! SAVE ME!
774;AN027DA;My pleasure.
1324;AI003CA;Wings confirmed damaged!
790;AM080AB;Oh my gosh!
1736;AD017DA;Come on, get into range!
3970;AE137_012;Great work. The enemy didn't know what hit him. Let's get to the next target.
1864;AE143_024;How come it's coming down this way?
551;AG012BB;Come here!
650;AE112_013;I see.
1355;AEX04_008;Infantry units, move in!
1643;AM147BE;You watch too much TV!
2043;AEX04_329;CONFIRMED! BUILDING EATING MONSTER!
2101;AE168_040;Infantry unit! We'll take it from here!
996;AE045BD;Attack your right!
1053;AP019BB;How's that?
1286;AS005DC;LET ME DOWN!
2369;AE157_024;So, they're finally here.
6756;AU022V;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
1498;AE002_043;Let's move to the hangar, quickly!
6770;AU112BC;Deep into the darkness, marching on, We fear no danger, we stay strong!
1431;AE121_060;Retreat! Hurry!
748;AM063BD;Can't do.
1762;AEX04_460;THESE ARE ALIEN CHILDREN!
2955;AE144_017;This is Scout. Flying-type monsters are drawing close.
997;AC013BE;The fight is starting.
1560;AE195_009;A teleportation anchor!
2240;AE106_027;Defeat those things and get out of here now!
505;AY049BC;Welcome.
2496;AF009AB;Move to a better position, before the enemy finds us.
4381;AE145_034;These are bipedal robots, and it looks like they are carrying some kind of weapon!
1553;AE144_007;How come there are so many?!
2784;AE146_048;I'm the only survivor. Request for support.
5579;AEX04_117;Fire countdown, three, two, one, fire.
1366;AF006BC;The enemy is off guard.
2224;AE206_028;You've shown everyone what we humans are made of.
1146;AE137_011;Tug it down!
1345;AL035DD;I made it alive.
1531;AA117BD;The mission is too hard.
1708;AT301BC;Thanks for saving me!
6100;AE210_076;If it escapes, all our sacrifices will be for nothing! We have to destroy it here and now!
656;AA015AC;Don't let up!
1733;AE107_032;They are emerging from underground!
2004;AA013CB;Dodge first, attack later.
2688;AE103_010;So the monsters are transported by that pylon?
962;AM153BA;Oh, is that right?
964;AG004ZA;Let's go!
2909;AE160_009;Those aliens look more disgusting at night.
2797;AA135BC;We're Superman when we're in powered exoskeletons!
1822;AE178_002;The base is occupied by the enemies.
1554;AF004DA;Now's the best time to assault.
1207;AM151DB;Money is important.
1705;AT102AC;I can't move! Save me!
1769;AM166BB;Anything you want. My treat.
2138;AA070DA;I can still fly, even if we're underground.
2285;AL002Z;E.D.F. E.D.F.
2330;AA027AB;Trust yourselves, and trust your superiors.
3716;AE109_014;Its skin is so tough, the bullets just bounced off!
2860;AE131_007;It's an unknown world ahead. Proceed cautiously.
2984;AE127_025;There are too many! We can't stop them by ourselves!
883;AY058BA;I'm sorry.
804;AE003CA;Hi-yah!
1480;AE177_024;Those were some tough opponents!
1001;AE053BD;We're in combat!
707;AR016BB;One dead.
1413;AEX04_349;Confirmed. Tadpole.
794;AE179_019;TOLD YOU!
2269;AN003AC;Don't mess around, civilian. Leave it to us.
3133;AA130BB;Thanks to the powered exoskeleton, it feels weightless!
5881;AE148_012;Robots that could fight regardless of the terrain? Can't believe they created these fearsome machineries!
1771;AF007BA;Enemy in sight! Let's attack!
1465;AM114BC;That's absolutely wrong.
1821;AD017BA;Shoot them dead once they're in range!
7669;AE174_028;Improving the general utility, so their invasion can be more effective. They have mastered the art of invasion.
1788;AE211_126;Storm 4, ATTACK!
1585;AC008AA;Careful! The enemy is around!
1022;AM054BC;I'll take care of this!
2030;AE002_130;Contact! A large group of monsters!
2692;AT007BC;It's pulling me away! Somebody help!
1834;AE116_004;Commence operation! Let's go!
3112;AZ050G;Attack finished. Ground forces, please keep fighting.
3634;AEX04_541;That thing is arcallous! What a fearsome creature!
1946;AV001V;Rescue the people caught in the web!
1889;AZ001I;This is artillery, all prepped and ready.
2187;AS006EC;Nooooooo!
1566;AK010DB;Looks like there's something approaching!
3866;AA009X;It's easy to be a soldier. Just don't dream about being promoted.
640;AH003BC;Evade!
1963;AE035BD;I'll make you a side dish!
673;AE143_071;What's wrong?
958;AM082DC;It's not like that!
1206;AE142_009;MOVE! MOVE!
828;AE185_002;STAY ALERT!
1544;AT203BA;Go save the ones caught in the web!
1472;AA042BD;There's someone waiting for you at home?
3324;AE063BC;It's too strong! That's not what I was told!
1282;AE036AA;I'LL LEAVE THE FRONT TO YOU!
2879;AF015BC;I must move in carefully, without being spotted.
979;AM066DB;That's what I was taught.
1417;AL029BD;I killed the last one!
2313;AA138BB;How can we lose to the Wing Divers?
1879;AEX04_381;CONFIRMED! GIGANTIC URGINOUS!
868;AE129_043;What just happened?
901;AM049AA;Great idea!
2284;AR002W;No one can replace you! Please, get up!
1286;AE126_009;Aliens confirmed!
3885;AE159_069;Abort the attack on the nest. Let's defeat the flying aggressors nearby first.
933;AL006DD;YEAH!
923;AM104BE;That's what I heard!
2786;AA078BE;I can't stand it anymore. I want to go home.
1072;AY017BD;Easy peasy.
6810;AU152X;Why should I still keep on fighting on shooting monster dead from dusk till dawn?
1281;AO009DC;Cool down the system!
1176;AE015DA;You can't hit me!
2055;AE105_072;The gigantic ship is ascending!
907;AA019AB;Did you check the guns?
822;AE028BB;Watch out, buddy!
3726;AE145_001;The troops have arrived! End of surveillance!
4036;AE147_007;We are equipped with anti-material sniper rifles. Leave them to us.
1319;AM141BE;You are so funny.
3122;AE175_014;That's a terrifying opponent. Never let your guards down.
1156;AM158BC;You had a dream like that?
862;AD004BA;Ready to shoot!
458;AQ004AC;GAAH!
953;AM027W;Leave it to me!
2593;AE198_073;The combat strength of the Baga team is decreasing.
1201;AM102DD;Now's not the time!
1430;AM113DD;I'm not interested.
1195;AD013AC;All ready to fire!
2102;AF010BE;We should be able to take down the enemy now.
5426;AE169_013;Just like its name, that thing's got outstanding fighting ability. Like a king. Must look out for it.
6853;AU012BA;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
2112;AE206_006;I don't suppose we'll get any backup.
1674;AF004Y;Now looks like a good time to attack.
1413;AE131_070;There seems to be a road ahead!
938;AL015BC;All wiped out.
774;AM010V;Good job!
1108;AT205BA;I'LL DESTROY THE WEB
1767;AD012BD;Show it to them once they're in range!
1026;AJ006BE;WE NEED RESCUE!
322;AE001CA;HA!
1799;AE147_026;Destroy the new-type drones!
3679;AA031ZA;Only few wing divers survived. Try your best to stay alive.
961;AA040BA;Are you shaking?
2310;AEX04_133;Transferring coordinates to the satellite.
761;AM139BA;That's the rumor.
2663;AE159_013;This is Team Two, Flying Type Discovered.
1191;AE140_016;I'm mentally prepared.
1114;AZ013G;Marker confirmed.
1096;AF012DB;This is the chance!
1782;AO010BB;Oh no! I'm out of ammo!
7602;AU031BB;High up in the air our comrades fight, Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light.
4681;AE155_022;It's shooting at us from the high ground! It must be trying to make the threats fly farther!
3086;AE138_033;Goddamn aliens! Time to bring out the trump card!
3776;AZ011N;Barren Land to Air Raiders, preparing for next launch.
2007;AA017DB;Wingdivers even have dietary rules.
1348;AE002_094;The ceiling is collapsing!
4446;AE143_042;These giant teleportation anchors will be called big anchors from now on!
2852;AE137_020;Eliminate all enemies except the mobile base.
1246;AM008X;I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU!
787;AY066BE;My bad.
1266;AL020DA;Switch to cruise mode.
983;AE137_014;Very well done.
1031;AM067Y;Trying to make me laugh!
4406;AE176_039;Those ball-shaped monsters are natural enemies of AFV!
1345;AR020BD;AN ALLY IS DOWN!
988;AE018BD;I'll back you up!
1436;AA046BA;I was a cook before I enlisted.
2223;AA106BE;I was still a security guard until last week.
2238;AE112_025;It's hopeless! Abandon the base!
1302;AR001X;Please don't die on us!
4122;AE121_015;We can't get close! If we stay here, we will all die!
3232;AZ002N;This is barren land. Please send attack coordinates.
2219;AE208_006;Earth will be doomed if we can't destroy it!
1149;AC022DA;Now is the time!
1921;AA102BC;Tell my family I fought bravely.
1950;AL013AB;Report that we've eliminated enemies around!
4523;AE103_032;Well, my friend in Europe just told me that Marseille is being attacked by thousands of monsters.
777;AM073AB;That can't be!
598;AO013DD;Landed!
1982;AM072BB;I can't meet those expectations!
2279;AN021AC;I've heard about you. Let's fight together.
1658;AN023BB;You're lucky. I'll help you.
3746;AE134_003;We stopped them from multiplying, but nothing has changed!
1331;AJ006BA;We need rescue!
1605;AF002DD;The enemy hasn't caught us!
2171;AE135_012;Are they trying to sting us to death?
1620;AE199_018;THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM!
2110;AE021V;Protect the people! It's our duty!
2150;AT302AA;Did you destroy the net? Great job!
1493;AM152DA;That's the kind of woman I am.
2188;AD012BC;Show it to them once they're in range.
1194;AH025BD;Are you alright, Captain?
4598;AE211_117;These are heavily armed aliens. They must be his personal bodyguards.
2378;AM190BD;Because I want money and fame.
1253;AS007AA;Figure something out!
1789;AA123BC;Let's scare the enemy to death!
2154;AD003DC;The enemy is outside the shooting range!
1726;AM175BB;Because I'm the ally of justice.
905;AM036AB;Let me think about it.
1125;AE146_025;An ally did it!
1994;AL003CA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1955;AEX04_265;Confirmed. Species alpha.
1835;AA003DB;I can't bring shame to the elite unit.
490;AY049BB;Welcome!
1728;AR041BC;How dare you shoot my men!
967;AY034BC;Ugh.
7567;AU141CB;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
2893;AE141_064;You want to blow up that beast too? Count me in.
2568;AE187_008;This is a difficult mission, but it has to be done.
2336;AT107DA;Stay away! It's a trap!
1341;AE144_002;FLYING TYPES ARE COMING!
1771;AE103_005;Retreat! Find cover!
6359;AE119_062;The air raid made it in time, but even if there are survivors, it's hard to deal with so many monsters.
2571;AA028Z;Cave adventure. Pretty exciting!
2025;AE111_043;Monsters are coming! Save us!
4338;AE179_038;This must be very important if we are going out of our way to get it.
3136;AT008BB;It uses its thread to capture its prey to eat!
3522;AE210_088;Please, everybody! We have to destroy it now!
1216;AM060CA;I can't believe this.
7394;AU011CB;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry. We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1375;AE021W;I'LL LEAVE THE RIGHT TO YOU!
618;AM038CB;Yeah, sure.
1997;AA041AB;Keep going! Don't be afraid of the dark!
573;AB002Z;Keep up!
6950;AU132DB;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
918;AM123BA;That's not right!
2481;AF010AC;Proceed carefully. Don't get caught by the enemy.
2320;AY048DC;From now on, I am part of your unit.
1223;AE009W;NOW'S THE CHANCE!
1111;AR009AB;Defend those now!
2490;AE160_017;An enemy landing ship has appeared in the sky.
1053;AE179_059;I can open it!
3423;AE178_026;Air Force arrives. Use hooligans to destroy the teleportation ships.
1205;AS001FC;NOOOOOOO!
7017;AU122DC;We shall not allow these aliens to rule the homo sapiens
1365;AG016BE;IT'S SHOWTIME!
1873;AE132_027;KILL ALL THE MONSTERS!
6777;AU152BE;But why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
1008;AM007DD;Don't give up!
246;AE001DD;HEY!
2042;AEX04_020;Enemy coming from the front and rear!
2238;AF027BB;Are we launching the surprise attack or not?
2240;AF027BC;Are we launching this surprise attack or not?
1474;AA066AC;Don't let Rangers beat us to it!
1678;AV001ZA;Rescue our buddies, caught in the web!
1890;AT107BA;Damn! I can't move!
7639;AU141W;Farewell my comrades, the time has come, it's over now, my love and my family are all gone.
1026;AE040BE;HAVING FUN?
1746;AE059BA;AHHHHH!
2304;AZ005PA;I'll grant you to use this power again.
2979;AA115BA;I only did training. Now I'm doing the actual fight.
4150;AZ027I;STOP BOMBING! Air raiders, please continue to fight.
1575;AI003DA;Fail to increase output!
484;AM033BD;Roger.
661;AM041AC;NEXT TIME!
879;AQ012BC;I've been shot!
1415;AM114DA;You love daydreaming!
1172;AJ009BE;Let's stay here and fight!
3768;AA113BE;I heard about the war situation. EDF has a commanding lead.
597;AY022DC;Hehe.
1347;AM101BC;It's common sense!
847;AH006BD;I'll back you up!
2369;AA045AC;There are enemies hiding around. Stay focused.
664;AH003DA;Hold on!
723;AM053CA;Thank you!
2418;AA134BE;Show them the strength of heavy firepower!
1190;AM128DC;I'm really grateful.
1124;AE166_019;What are those guys?
792;AM037X;N E G A T I V E
1259;AY004DA;I barely escaped!
2524;AA021Y;Looks like we'll get a death pension instead of the annuity.
3398;AE115_022;There are some units remaining in the city. I want to know the situation.
1477;AA036DD;We'll return alive!
923;AE166_002;Go, go, go!
1725;AE164_031;Let's cover the troops in combat!
1017;AA083BA;We're not lost, are we?
2025;AA008BA;It's just fighting, easy.
2490;AE119_031;Everyone head to the shore
3734;AE143_053;They appear to show extreme reactions towards certain pollutants.
649;AM029CA;Denied.
1488;AA082BA;I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.
2251;AA017DA;Wingdivers even have dietary rules!
1429;AEX04_297;CONFIRMED, QUEEN
1375;AR025BD;Bring me a coffin!
1177;AE117_032;Wing Diver, roger!
1135;AEX04_342;Alien incoming!
968;AT001DC;I can't fly!
2239;AE111_003;Looks like the situation is the same everywhere!
1552;AL029BB;I killed the last one!
2313;AE124_011;SEND IN THE REINFORCEMENT! HURRY!
978;AM021DB;You did it!
2381;AZ039G;End of attack. Wait for the next operation.
4726;AE154_008;That mother monster will spit lots of acid. Remember to hide in the buildings to avoid it.
1668;AE158_015;The Shield Bearers are right below!
877;AK007DC;There's something coming!
2390;AN025BC;So, you're my boss.
1624;AM090BD;That's what the drill sergeant said too.
3366;AE178_027;Three, two, one, fire!
779;AEX04_557;Start the attack!
1685;AT303AA;That's close! I owe you.
1105;AE179_020;Monsters
1807;AE153_007;Next three, engaging hostiles.
765;AM055AB;Cut it out.
1450;AM111BA;It only seems like that.
637;AM076AA;What?!
334;AM153DC;Eh?
4110;AA045X;We came underground to take out the aliens. Why did it turn out like this?
1786;AD009CA;Confirm distance with the enemy!
3158;AA015DC;With this aerial unit, monsters are nothing.
570;AM170BA;Thank you!
2198;AC013DC;Plasma Drive, output increases.
1331;AO008BB;I'M OUT OF AMMO!
6805;AU122CA;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo-savians.
2042;AD014DC;I'll shoot you dead once you step into range.
1624;AE164_037;Shoot all drones down.
1732;AN035BB;I've heard everything about you.
988;AM069BE;Impossible!
1540;AE115_001;Listen, everyone.
4412;AE141_114;There seemed to be new weapons involved. They used it to weaken the aliens before the fight.
1231;AG003BD;The enemy is moving!
321;AM058BA;No.
1587;AP010BD;We hit it! Direct hit!
5552;AE115_032;Attack their weapon holding hand, then they won't be able to use weapons before a new hand generates!
1128;AM023DC;I'll reward you later!
2931;AE107_037;We can't leave them like this! Destroy them all!
1152;AM010BB;Don't be discouraged!
1654;AE119_020;THERE IS A SWARM OF ENEMIES!
6019;AE211_069;It may have acknowledged Storm One as a special human specimen. All we can do is make a final push.
1162;AC003BC;I'll show you what I have.
2179;AN011CA;The legendary captain. It can't be.
3907;AE004_024;That alien is a soldier! The alien infantry is here!
736;AN016DA;All yours.
1441;AE211_042;Divine halo
2149;AA086BC;I don't hate dark and narrow places.
940;AD001BE;The enemy is here!
1456;AG002DC;Let the flying combat begin!
864;AY023BC;This is
953;AL005CB;Oh!
1219;AM028CA;Can we wait a little longer?
588;AM046BB;YES!
994;AN012BB;I'll fight with you.
2027;AM120BB;You'd better be sure before you say anything.
1344;AR005CB;Hah! My men!
2382;AEX04_611;Sniper Team is on standby. Rendezvous with them.
1365;AT301DC;Thank you for coming to help!
3525;AZ002R;It's difficult to provide artillery backup under the current situation.
1103;AM074DA;So I see!
2210;AA014Z;Blast Hole Spear is life!
1785;AD004CA;Shoot right after you enter the range!
1424;AE181_020;You've damaged Arceles!
4179;AE202_045;What the hell? This is a joke! JOKES!
2192;AA098BC;Let me breathe the air outside.
905;AK008AC;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
2102;AE185_017;Species gamma are closing in on us!
2940;AEX04_095;Fighters have reached target point. Beginning air raid.
1098;AM055Y;Unfortunately, no.
1418;AT202DA;Someone is stuck in the web!
3893;AA019W;The bank was blown away. Who can protect my savings now?
646;AM062BE;I'm sorry.
3258;AS003EC;Ahahahahaahaaaaaaahhhh!!!
1150;AM082DB;It's not like that.
1700;AE162_017;Teleportation ship destroyed!
904;AA001Z;Keep an eye out!
1376;AB009BC;They want us to run!
1414;AF016CB;They'll see us if we shoot!
2223;AEX04_511;These battle robots are called Deroys!
660;AM034V;That's right!
310;AM051BE;Hmph!
1701;AM003X;We'll bring the medic to you later!
2810;AE145_079;We will send out the rescue teams. Stay alive!
3180;AE196_008;FENCERS HAVE ENGAGED THE ENEMY. PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT.
591;AM065AC;Thank you!
1670;AN005Y;It's all on you now, Storm One!
1028;AM007Z;That's great!
396;AM043AA;Yeah.
1513;AM082W;I'm a man on a mission.
2310;AF020BE;Don't get too close, or you will be exposed.
1515;AO010DB;Weapon system, cool down!
856;AE141_094;Enemy status.
4128;AA018DA;I'm grateful that I've been able to fly in the sky every day since I became a soldier.
2198;AE165_013;Teleportation ship! Just one left!
2304;AA026BE;Even in this situation, I feel hungry.
420;AQ001X;Ugh.
3009;AE122_016;We'll be killed if they follow us! We must fight to survive!
643;AE100_015;That's it!
683;AO001ZA;Charge!
3280;AE128_051;I'm returning for supplies! Don't die on me, ground units!
2376;AE142_007;There seems to be other monsters! Let's go!
803;AM031BD;Yes, sir!
2003;AE112_005;Teleportation ship's identified!
2009;AA023DD;PlasmaDrive Output Stable
4829;AE129_030;We have to get close to the base to set up the bombs! Take down the enemies nearby!
1296;AE104_066;Is that a spaceship?
922;AM061BD;I can't do that!
1292;AE141_108;OH YEAH!
431;AM046BE;Yes!
2420;AEX02_006;HEY YOU! TIME TO RETREAT!
2069;AE114_049;IT'S THE ALIEN INFANTRY UNITS!
2333;AM003CB;Keep flying until we beat down the enemy!
2114;AF013AC;Don't shoot yet. Let's keep approaching.
1889;AE168_031;I can't see the enemy in this fog!
1271;AR018BA;An ally got chewed up!
2142;AR008BE;I can't believe the captain is chewed up!
2021;AT106DD;I'm not able to move at all!
1955;AE143_023;Again! And this time there's more!
1019;AE138_031;Drones incoming!
2033;AE192_005;Looks like these eggs are water resistant.
825;AP011DB;We did it!
2577;AT304DC;Awesome! You saved my life!
1081;AD008Z;Prepare to strike!
427;AM015ZA;Okay.
1490;AE159_004;Team 2, Roger.
945;AH003CA;Protect the injured!
1480;AC010DC;I will take down the enemies!
2027;AE147_009;The majority of the drones have been destroyed!
6687;AU142V;Here, still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1386;AK009BD;I heard there is the enemy!
1815;AW002V;That was close! I owe you!
1378;AE023BB;EAT THE BULLET!
1642;AEX04_551;WHERE'S THE BLOODY BACKUP?!
1895;AE003_046;There is one monster left!
863;AM016V;Well done!
913;AL015W;Any injured here?
494;AM028ZA;Alright!
592;AN003Y;You lead!
1173;AE186_024;Destroy the nest!
1338;AA051DB;I have a smart brain.
1807;AA003CA;We are the fastest soldiers!
2296;AN022AB;It's my honor to fight with a hero.
974;AY047DC;I'll fight with you!
1691;AA081DA;I'm really good at flying at night."
1191;AB012BD;I'm tired already!
867;AK002AB;The enemy is here!
354;AP007BC;SHIT!
3516;AA094DB;I was just a civilian pilot. My friends all joined the EDF.
7322;AE115_033;Headshots can kill aliens instantly, but it's too hard to shoot one in the head. Attack the body, try to knock them down.
1210;AK003ZA;Enemy reactions!
949;AE125_030;Go support them!
4629;AEX01_010;The Spriggan unit. They aren't cute and cuddly. They're witches!
3018;AE115_017;I'M SURROUNDED BY THE ALIENS! I'M DONE!
1185;AM149DD;Because I'm pretty!
2141;AI020BB;I've seen worse! This is nothing!
1452;AM200BA;It's a long story.
1835;AL005BC;YEAH!
5727;AE150_034;The latest gun model, it's for personal use, but it's ten times more powerful than an EMC.
1267;AE185_015;A species gamma!
1006;AT107AA;DESTROY THE WEB
597;AG001Z;Let's go!
1017;AY056BE;I'm outta here!
1804;AI014BD;I'll be in trouble if I don't figure it out!
1152;AA034BE;Don't go crazy!
1186;AH005DB;I will cover the wounded!
3068;AE173_013;Did the monsters, and not the drones, destroy the city?
2470;AD002Y;Wait till the enemy comes closer, and then attack!
1202;AT202BA;Someone's caught in the web!
1623;AM198BC;I didn't really think it through.
897;AM035BE;Sir, yes sir!
1707;AL010BE;EDF! EDF!
10058;AE202_080;Mythology or not, there's a chance that the enemy has a central command ship. If we destroy it, we might take down their entire fleet. If such a command ship actually exists, that is.
1504;AT105DA;I can't escape!
2957;AE121_010;We have to take out those drones before we can attack the base.
1421;AJ006BB;We need rescue!
2306;AE139_002;The newbie's staying, so I'm staying.
9911;AE115_025;Attention to the units in the city. The bulk of the alien army has left the region. Now is your chance to escape. Defeat the surrounding enemies and secure the escape route.
7699;AU021DB;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
1037;AC002CA;Approaching the enemy!
1450;AF006DB;Let's draw closer to the enemy.
5439;AE210_017;But there is still hope. Forces in North America are still trying to take down Mothership Three.
939;AE032BC;Great chance!
885;AM003BA;I'm coming to help!
1209;AR031BE;Joe got chewed up!
3259;AE129_058;Are those legs? The bass is walking!
1096;AY033DC;I'm disappointed.
3763;AEX04_476;It's aliens! They seem to be carrying powerful weapons!
858;AC013BA;The fight is starting.
2442;AE205_016;Our mission is to rescue Storm Four!
3391;AE138_008;Infantry units without shields, stay behind the titans!
1920;AE200_006;Grim Reaper, rush them down!
2124;AE141_008;Hide behind the Titans! Move!
2060;AE107_052;If there really is such a place.
882;AE031AC;SHOOT IN THE FRONT!
563;AE026BB;NOW!
2356;AE071BE;NO ILLEGAL EMIGRANTS ALLOWED!
498;AM058X;WHAT?!
1165;AE005_041;Formation beta
1233;AE133_008;Monsters confirmed!
1340;AY016DD;Mission complete.
1850;AE161_005;Hmph! They seem slow!
966;AM022V;LET'S TRY IT!
1760;AR004BE;Oh no! We lost our captain!
1831;AG002DD;Let the flying combat begin!
7849;AU151BA;Abandoned by my friends and family, alone in the city surrounded by the enemy.
762;AM053AC;That's not true.
4052;AE112_029;Leave it to us! We're gonna destroy the teleportation ships from the ground!
1141;AM012X;So you are pro!
850;AY074DC;You're good enough.
2452;AE002_110;I'LL OPEN THE BLAST DOOR NOW! BACK OFF!
565;AM016BA;Great!
1249;AE174_002;INCOMING!
1698;AT110BE;Somebody destroy the web!
766;AH002BD;Dodge!
2964;AEX04_532;Monsters are coming out from the teleportation device!
760;AE191_014;FOLLOW ME!
585;AY045BB;Good evening.
2423;AE201_003;The enemy's on the other side! Let's go!
1248;AM074BC;We can't afford that!
1302;AE002_071;THEY'RE ALL DESTROYED!
2412;AM179BC;Because I can't keep myself out of this!
6753;AE199_034;The fact that they are sending those monsters can only mean one thing. They've reached the final stage of their invasion.
7032;AA098DB;I plan to go back to being an air show performer after my honorary discharge. I'm confident in doing an amazing show now.
2890;AE129_052;Well done. Demolition team, take it from here.
1143;AH023BA;The captain is injured!
3441;AA097DD;I think I'll stick with flying after leaving the military services.
1713;AE020Z;We've cleaned up all the big shots!
2585;AE119_036;IT'S THE FENCER'S DUTY TO STAY BEHIND!
2292;AE186_051;I DON'T THINK WE CAN HANDLE THIS!
2761;AI002AA;If I go down, they're under your command.
855;AM001BE;Hold on!
803;AM016DC;I'm impressed!
1018;AR016DB;Someone fell!
1128;AE171_004;We'll act as gorillas!
291;AM029BE;Got it.
350;AE001ZA;Hi!
2864;AE211_003;It's the pilot of the command ship! Take it under arrest!
2126;AE126_002;Pile on sighted! Destroy them!
1215;AE052BA;ATTACK THE BODY!
990;AA069BD;Do you regret?
723;AY026DD;Haha!
2620;AE170_002;If we don't do something, we'll all die!
1636;AE005_024;It survived the airstrike!
1053;AM048DB;That won't work.
1871;AA091BC;It feels like a ghost might come out.
1306;AE121_050;The drones are coming!
1177;AE130_010;This way, hurry!
536;AM035Y;NEGATIVE!
1007;AR009DA;Isn't the captain here?
2027;AS010BA;Bastard let go of me
463;AM060AB;Thank you.
2196;AD005DA;Confirmed distance, outside the range.
1314;AE133_019;THERE'S SEVERAL OF THEM!
760;AM028V;Stop it!
4870;AE157_018;We have found new alien weapons in Australia. We will call them Shield Bearers.
851;AN022BD;Nice meeting you.
1715;AJ004W;Calm down! Don't panic!
1360;AM004AA;Stay there! I'm coming!
720;AB002DA;Whoa!
1641;AE210_112;You're lucky to be alive
990;AE015W;BODYSHOT!
3091;AE002_070;Damn it! The powered exoskeletons have been destroyed!
2414;AZ027Q;Transport Chopper to Air Raiders, vehicle dropped.
2520;AT003W;What the hell is it? I can't move!
1214;AM160BB;You saved me!
1113;AZ005N;SEND IN COORDINATES
6950;AU012X;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
2465;AE131_050;You alright? I'm here to help.
1430;AR006BA;Captain, please reply!
380;AM037BB;Sure!
692;AM056AB;YOU'RE WRONG!
1879;AA029ZA;Be a bat flying in the cave!
1381;AY057BB;When this is over, I'm out.
754;AK014BB;NEW ENEMY!
538;AM066AC;Thank you!
1585;AEX04_459;Winged Aliens confirmed!
945;AK007DB;There's something coming!
7224;AE001_003;You might be familiar with directing traffic, but there are tanks and powered exoskeletons in the base, so you gotta watch out.
1682;AJ009BD;Let's stay here and FIGHT!
3138;AE204_006;Stop! You've got no chance. Just run!
3576;AE002_158;Nothing's more terrifying than an army of monstrous living creatures.
2666;AA074DB;I've never been trained to fly underground.
890;AM022AC;I'll remember that!
1189;AO032BC;RELOAD BULLETS!
690;AM016AB;WELL DONE
1261;AE100_008;Behind this gate is...
2308;AE126_006;Monsters are coming out from the pylons
3035;AF007DA;Approaching target. Don't get dragged into a tangled battle.
2158;AEX04_287;Confirmed. Teleportation anchor.
3338;AA108BE;I have always wanted to be a soldier, now my dream comes true.
947;AD012DC;That's not good enough!
1043;AY072DC;We'll think of something.
2789;AT305DD;You saved me, right? How should I thank you?
1561;AL032BB;We took out the last one!
1135;AP002BD;We took out the enemy!
1168;AE198_067;MULTIPLE ARCULUS?!
370;AY037BE;Hi!
1417;AE014W;ATTACK THE ARMS!
5151;AA133BA;With a powered exoskeleton, even weak men can be strong. But you must train yourself.
1284;AO006BE;Reloading! Back me up!
1326;AM010BD;DON'T BE DISCOURAGED!
542;AE129_065;Fall back!
2837;AZ003QB;This is Scarrier, we'll head for the combat area again.
2334;AE159_056;Destroy all flying type in the surrounding area.
1910;AD015DB;I can't wait any longer! Let me shoot!
1025;AL037BA;That's enough.
1555;AJ005Y;Someone contact the headquarters!
2480;AE180_017;Stomp the enemy! Attack them with your feet!
2868;AE110_009;Back off, or we'll get caught in the air raid!
1728;AI007DC;Stabilizer condition four!
1727;AT303AC;That's close. I owe you.
5005;AZ041G;This is DE-202, shooting ended. Best luck to the ground forces.
2894;AZ001L;Submarine aircraft carrier Epimetheus surfaced.
1173;AM019BE;THAT'S AMAZING!
2089;AEX04_153;Missile entering target area.
849;AK008BA;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
2604;AE201_001;Let's eradicate the alien that is leading the monsters!
1648;AQ014BD;WAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
1749;AA057DB;I don't dislike idiots.
4374;AE204_021;This is Strategic Command HQ. Are there any survivors out there?
2466;AA012BE;Actual fighting is much more fun than training.
613;AM033V;OK.
461;AM034DA;Got it!
995;AM081DD;You're wrong.
1112;AK001CB;HERE'S THE ENEMY!
3692;AZ003G;This is DE-202, ready to attack anytime.
2526;AL010DA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
795;AM062AB;Let me thank you.
1638;AC012DC;Weapon system, activate!
1372;AJ003DD;Isn't the back up here yet?
1507;AA063BE;How about singing a song?
450;AE150_023;Huh?
1013;AE119_003;And what's wrong with that?
921;AE168_022;Threads are coming!
3011;AE003_030;They should be all evacuated by now, but we can't be sure of that.
942;AI010BC;I need help!
1185;AM150BC;Alright, I got it!
1701;AE130_003;Fall back! Fall back!
1831;AR005V;Get up! Hold on!
4448;AA095DB;Once you fly in the sky, you hear people applauding. I really miss that.
6550;AE146_015;This is Scout! Looks like the aliens that are occupying the city have decreased. It's likely they're moving to somewhere else.
1574;AH005CA;Confirm damage of the wings!
1072;AL026BA;You did great too!
2059;AW001X;Thank goodness! I owe you my life!
2636;AA012AA;Count on each other as brothers. Fight together.
1092;AM137DC;I've got no choice.
1269;AT202BE;Someone is caught in the web!
722;AG005Y;Engage!
2094;AE005_016;And I can't date for the world at this time!
2883;AEX04_563;The reinforcement will arrive any minute. Hang in there.
4926;AE003_028;Crap! Can't believe that the powered exoskeleton can't be activated in such a crucial moment!
3006;AA141BA;The powered exoskeletons were originally a military technology.
5336;AE174_029;The long-legged and the short-legged will be called long-type and short-type from now on.
1972;AN005DA;I'll protect you until we leave the battlefield.
2007;AE130_024;Enemies are coming out from the base!
1475;AA058BE;Let's hang out tonight, everyone!
4883;AE118_024;The creature's power is beyond our understanding. What a terrifying opponent.
1131;AN011DB;We're joining your team.
1595;AA027DA;Stabilizer, condition one.
678;AL012DD;CLEAR!
371;AM029BA;Got it!
938;AM098BD;That's the truth!
2854;AE112_047;This is Wing Diver, heading in to cover the attack team.
966;AM018AC;That's worth a medal!
1205;AT107AB;DESTROY THE WEB!
1216;AE171_028;Arcalis approaching!
2664;AE012Z;GAAAAAAAH!
2373;AM178BD;Because I can't let them take over the earth like that!
4663;AE129_026;The demolition team cannot approach under this condition. Take down the teleportation ships!
590;AM033ZA;No!
2494;AE108_012;Contact! Species beta is coming!
1013;AE145_022;Ready to move in!
1203;AZ003M;Coordinates confirmed.
1024;AE117_016;Monster sighted!
3083;AT311DB;It turns out all I heard is true. Thank you.
466;AY053BE;See you!
6681;AU132BE;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
3604;AE210_097;Nearby troops have been assembled. Deployment will soon follow.
927;AO002Y;Reloading now!
1958;AE210_129;This is great news! We hit it!
1218;AE002_141;Good grief
2716;AA019X;Who came up with this operation? Give me a break.
1383;AM110DB;You're a genius!
2069;AC014BD;If the enemy is near, I'll take care of it.
1184;AY017DB;Easy peasy.
2081;AO012BC;Damn! My magazine is cracked!
1744;AA063DA;Why would people like you...
2121;AE142_013;Finish them! Leave none alive!
2208;AE211_013;Is that... God?
1932;AE155_011;People are tangled by the threads!
1040;AC001V;Everyone stay alert!
2107;AE139_004;I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
1446;AE004_023;The aliens have weapons!
1071;AA005FD;Stop it!
3957;AE199_015;They ate the inside of the building and are starting to multiply!
2112;AE122_011;Keep fighting and collecting data!
7701;AU121CA;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucers, shooting down a foe
540;AM052CB;Thank you.
1860;AA043AB;Exterminate the enemies underground!
2243;AC019DA;See if you can handle the attack from the sky!
2169;AE113_026;Monsters are coming from underground!
761;AP008BD;Nice hit.
2371;AI016BD;Oh no, my eyes are blurry!
2474;AA070DD;I can still fly, even if we're underground.
1312;AE166_008;Blood 2, roger.
852;AM017AC;You're doing great!
963;AE166_001;Strike
3201;AE202_046;You are the sole survivor. It's good to hear you're fine.
7336;AE129_048;I know, the strike team will be in position soon. If the demolition fails, we will destroy the base with heavy tanks.
1119;AE176_017;Time for the next target!
2486;AF021BD;If you get too close, the enemy will notice you.
1589;AE211_005;If it resists, shoot it!
5336;AE150_013;They are really huge in size. We don't have to worry about shooting at the wrong targets.
4243;AE171_039;Attacks were effective! Maybe we can actually beat Arcalus this time!
2451;AE178_043;We've wiped out all enemy ground forces!
1180;AN006CA;This team will protect you.
1890;AA085DA;I so wanna go back outside.
2021;AN015AA;The top priority of this team is to support you.
1863;AL044BA;I'm hurt! Can I go home?
7074;AU012DB;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
1332;AF003DC;The enemy hasn't found us.
2737;AE002_172;Hey civilian, that was quite impressive.
2293;AO024BA;Watch closely at how I swap the magazine!
2444;AE191_029;Destroy each and every teleportation device.
824;AM014BE;AMAZING!
775;AM049AC;Great idea!
4035;AE182_011;Air Force has arrived! Air raiders, destroy the big anchors with an air raid!
1609;AL035DA;I made it alive.
1908;AE167_018;Big Anchor has been destroyed!
7424;AE111_041;There are far more monsters than we can handle. At this rate, it's only a matter of time till our society collapses.
1638;AQ004EE;AHHHHH
854;AQ002FA;Whoa!
1024;AL020AA;Let's chill out a bit.
2844;AA128BB;How can we lose with such powerful heavy armaments?
6906;AU132DA;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
886;AM119DC;Tell me the rest!
1065;AE180_001;Enemy's approaching!
1601;AA002FA;Noooooo!
5214;AE133_039;We can deal with the eggs later. Extinguishing those mother monsters is the top priority.
2818;AE211_018;What kind of weapon is that?
963;AM124BC;DON'T BE STUPID!
543;AY045BC;Good evening.
1779;AC017AA;We're in the enemy's range. All ready?
459;AB005Z;Go!
1459;AA011CA;Save the output of the generator.
5600;AE207_017;No, that's not it. They're trying to protect number 11. We have to get to the bottom of this.
1308;AA044DC;Are you mentally prepared?
1589;AEX04_106;Bombardment ceased.
982;AE008Z;Go to hell!
368;AM084Y;Huh?
667;AA038BD;Cover me!
1572;AL018DB;Plasma Drive, cool down!
1375;AM092BC;It's common sense.
1398;AA064DA;Why did you choose to fly?
1447;AK008DA;I feel an enemy nearby!
5509;AE141_093;120 powered exoskeletons of the latest model just arrived in Beijing.
1434;AE021DC;The sky belongs to me!
824;AQ003FA;AHHH!
1366;AD010BC;Let's do it! Don't miss!
930;AA062DC;Why are you here?
1219;AM083DC;You're completely wrong.
1071;AE183_004;Prepare for combat!
1768;AF001BE;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
1764;AE002_060;Let's go! Follow me!
881;AEX04_054;Two remaining.
1336;AE107_049;They're not our helicopters!
5238;AE176_040;Those ball-shaped monsters are drawing close! Infantry unit! Eliminate them when you're still armed!
4573;AE105_042;The gigantic mothership is moving. Looks like it's activating some kind of device.
1181;AM061DD;Yeah, probably.
1300;AK002Z;Our guests have arrived!
1756;AE164_027;Drones coming out from the mothership!
14019;AE110_044;These flying objects all flew to Earth at the same time, and started dropping monsters. Their targets were all major cities around the world, and air force bases. We must rise and fight for our survival!
1042;AM015X;I understand, sir.
1739;AE178_008;The Grim Reapers will protect you!
2000;AE127_036;STAY BACK, STAY BACK!
1592;AA091BE;It feels like a ghost might come out.
2237;AN027BD;So I'll take you as our acting captain.
1044;AE005_019;KUBAK KAI SHI!
720;AY070DC;Fine by me.
1856;AD012BB;Show it to them once they're in range.
1344;AC017DD;Switch to burst mode!
5532;AE173_009;The local air force was eliminated. We can only fight with our own fighters and transport aircrafts.
2240;AT002AA;I'm caught in the web! Get me out of this!
1252;AE005BC;GO TO HELL!
7253;AE138_013;If they break through, the city will go down in flames. We will not let that happen. We must hold the enemies back.
1949;AE149_033;It worked! We destroyed a Deroy!
443;AY024BE;Heh.
1032;AM129DC;I have to thank you.
2196;AA059BB;Are you a soy sauce or ketchup person?
1751;AA066DD;What are the reasons exactly?
2184;AR004BD;Oh no! We lost our captain!
1225;AK001V;THE ENEMY ARRIVED!
1145;AC004ZA;Prepare for battle!
6797;AU112BB;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong.
1955;AT104BB;Bastard I can't get out
637;AC011AC;KEEP WATCH!
1579;AA109BE;Being a soldier is my duty.
919;AY047BE;I'll fight with you.
2935;AE114_020;The Air Force must have failed, or else it wouldn't be our turn.
3624;AE120_011;I can't believe they sent a newbie to support the Spriggan.
531;AJ003X;CRAP
6122;AE211_111;Yet, we should put our faith in Storm One and pray.
477;AM081BE;That's right!
6780;AU152DA;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
2183;AE104_015;Which freaking country made these weapons?!
2714;AE112_051;Attack the Shining Pot once the hatch opens!
1672;AM027BB;You deserve my praise!
1179;AM051BC;Wow!
523;AE002DA;Yeah!
1666;AM091DD;Don't spread false info!
1624;AZ005M;Receiving Targets Coordinates.
3743;AA094DD;I was just a civilian pilot. My friends all joined the EDF.
3128;AZ028I;The bombing is over! Wishing the best to the ground units.
5042;AE210_137;Wait a second! What's that in the air? It looks... human!
1209;AE142_041;Look at that thread!
1115;AEX04_155;Missile fired!
3749;AE112_058;What a stunning display! We have obtained valuable data!
3265;AZ014K;This is Phobos. The attack is over. Leaving the combat area.
1327;AH022BB;Our man is injured!
532;AR008DC;Pause!
3570;AA140BE;Because the powered exoskeletons were developed by the military.
1073;AM205BC;Seriously?
2059;AA005EE;Someone save me!
1494;AT201AB;SAVE THOSE TANGLED BY THE WEB!
1939;AM072BC;I CAN'T MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS!
1243;AN031DB;I'm all yours, hero.
1457;AF007X;Let's fight to the death!
6871;AU172AC;Stad shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends We will storm ahead until the end
2678;AZ009J;Bomber to civilian, do you know the enemy's location?
1135;AI002BC;I've been shot!
1049;AC002BA;I'll fight with you, Captain!
1394;AE188_002;Flying objects incoming!
683;AH001AA;Evade!
2379;AE118_034;This is Dover Leader, we've arrived on the scene.
2792;AL014AA;That's the last one. Extermination complete.
1624;AE111_002;Have all the enemies gathered here?
2169;AEX04_294;CONFIRMED. SHORT TYPE DEROY.
1859;AA096DB;I have over 20 flying hours.
2422;AE057BC;Spend your time on something more meaningful!
1333;AT203DB;Someone is caught in the web!
1223;AE037BB;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
1957;AR003DB;Captain! Please respond!
6455;AE211_074;No, only God possesses such power, and that thing isn't God, it's an evil invader!
954;AE010Y;Don't mess with me!
1563;AE131_028;Monster movement detected!
1208;AL031BC;We're a great team!
1040;AR021BC;Someone got killed!
1197;AY047DD;I'll fight with you!
2684;AZ033I;You're a civilian, right? Proceed to evacuate.
903;AE124_001;ENEMY!
2795;AE121_038;I know, but we can't continue the mission anymore.
6774;AU142DA;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
3401;AE141_075;If this keeps up, we'll become the indigenous peoples!
1721;AY013BD;Thank you. I love you!
1504;AA033DC;Shock absorber, normal.
1584;AE174_012;Something is falling down!
3614;AZ029PB;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
1198;AA013Y;I will be promoted soon.
1037;AM079X;Thanks a lot!
2633;AE146_022;Did the aliens expect a rescue team?
1183;AA032AC;Let's reverse the tide!
452;AE136_014;Granted.
588;AL009AA;CLEAR!
2399;AE002_023;You goddamn monsters, I'll burn you!
796;AM033Y;That won't work.
543;AM031AB;Fine!
7697;AU161X;This city is nothing but despair. Oh, we're here with silence now because not a soul was spared.
616;AY068DA;It's all right.
1105;AH005BD;I'LL PROTECT YOU!
3542;AE118_011;It's too big! It's unlike any other monster we've seen before!
1032;AE171_043;Is it immortal?
1669;AE131_071;There seems to be a road ahead!
2714;AI003AA;Keep fighting! Even if I don't make it.
1776;AM087DD;You sure your eyes are okay?
1940;AZ004H;Air raiders leave it to us
1751;AN009V;Alright, let's fight together!
821;AM029AA;Okay!
1065;AM212BD;But that can't be!
528;AM172BC;Thanks!
2900;AA090DB;Wow, the military equipment is truly advanced.
5363;AE155_033;They're likely controlled by the aliens. We must eliminate the enemies before things get worse.
1840;AE141_034;Destroy the remaining cannons!
3008;AE119_035;We'll hold off the enemy! You all go down to the shore!
876;AV002Z;Break the web!
1303;AL019DB;Enter the cool-down mode.
1820;AO027BA;Reload! No need to cover me!
6840;AU022Y;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
1386;AJ004DD;We lost our commander!
9469;AE202_083;The Intelligence Division is in total chaos right now. Some have been trying to find the egg-shaped ship despite the fact that there isn't evidence of its existence.
3751;AE144_018;They might continue to breed on Earth. Destroy them all!
2649;AEX04_518;Monsters are coming out from the teleportation anchors!
710;AM066BC;Forget it!
1678;AE015V;Suppress them! Shoot!
764;AL031DA;I'll take a rest.
3603;AEX04_094;Fighters have reached overhead position. Beginning air raid.
1068;AF008DC;Has it noticed us yet?
805;AM028X;Understood!
1877;AE129_020;The weather is abnormal.
807;AG006BA;WE'RE SPOTTED!
3624;AE103_016;If the pylon falls into the city, it will cause heavy casualties!
3369;AE198_030;Why does the yellow light keep blinking?!
1435;AM157BC;Let's talk about it next time!
1090;AE006BB;WATCH THIS!
1138;AN009AA;I'll leave the team to you.
1633;AE164_015;Get into the building!
2635;AE201_017;DAMN IT! THIS IS OUR PLANET!
3260;AA067AA;Our weapons rival to Panzers. There's nothing to be afraid of.
694;AM024CA;Go ahead!
6663;AU142DC;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
724;AM098DC;It's not!
1315;AH023BD;THE CAPTAIN IS INJURED!
1149;AK014BD;NEW ENEMY!
1463;AE182_008;Destroyed! All big anchors!
3513;AE211_096;Win! We must win!
1245;AC003DB;I will follow the plan!
2089;AM009DA;Endure the pain! Let's keep fighting!
4091;AE119_034;The powered exoskeletons will hold off the enemy. Everyone, head to the shore.
1026;AM086DB;Did you take it wrong?
5317;AE115_023;This is Scout. Aliens have started moving. The number of aliens that occupy the city is decreasing.
2124;AE056BC;I've seen tons of movies like this!
885;AEX04_261;Lights on!
1272;AJ007DA;Continue the operation!
1983;AA089BB;It's my first time in a cave like this.
1929;AE003_024;Anyone capable of moving must fight!
1037;AQ012BA;I'M IN SHOD!
1532;AEX04_387;Monster in the vicinity!
1220;AM019DB;Amazing.
2072;AK005BD;Emergency contact! The enemy shows up!
1126;AE107_006;Roger! Let's go!
2453;AI002AB;If I go down, they're under your command.
1086;AO032BA;RELOAD BULLETS!
866;AM159DB;No way!
754;AE100_028;Almost there.
626;AL018AB;Good job.
2509;AE118_021;The tanks will arrive momentarily. Hang on!
5390;AE168_019;Monsters are attacking citizens from the thick fog! We've engaged them, but we're struggling because of the dense fog!
2836;AA139BC;It's my first time to use the military-powered exoskeleton.
1545;AEX04_303;Mothership is descending.
833;AM059AC;Don't be silly!
1078;AM005DB;I'll protect you all!
843;AM205BA;Seriously?
905;AM121DC;I'm bored!
994;AR017DC;One person is missing!
2256;AT309BD;Thanks to the hero that came to my rescue!
1160;AE181_009;Arcalis, incoming!
6709;AU162CB;Yet, we still keep fighting! The good fight! We trample our foes day and night!
4074;AE203_013;They want to eradicate us, but guess what? We're not going to retreat!
1580;AA002DD;I'm better than anyone else.
3999;AA021DC;With the power of the plasma drive, this kind of enemy is nothing.
707;AM007CA;AMAZING!
2067;AA032CB;The night flight training is coming in handy.
1741;AE035BC;I'LL MAKE YOU A SIDE DISH!
2367;AF010AA;Proceed carefully, don't get caught by the enemy.
667;AY044DD;Hello.
1998;AO011BC;Not good! I'm out of ammo!
1186;AZ006H;Prepare for bombing!
1232;AE186_040;WE ARE SURROUNDED!
1109;AM076BB;I would if I could!
1113;AM020DA;We can't lose!
990;AEX04_172;Secure this river!
491;AM046DA;Sorry.
1826;AH026BE;Captain! I won't let you die!
724;AE179_052;Unlock it!
1025;AM069BB;Impossible!
1465;AB008X;They want us to move forward!
597;AM007DB;Don't give up!
3486;AE199_006;Monsters eating the buildings? We're in deep trouble this time!
3233;AEX01_001;Spriggan unit deployed. They should arrive momentarily.
3835;AE138_065;I see. The enemies we've faced until now are only the advance party.
2584;AE179_065;Don't let the enemy destroy it during combat!
2305;AC025BC;I'll be the one who kills the most enemies!
706;AM048AA;That's right!
1472;AL035BB;It's harder than imagined.
1228;AI013BB;The wound is hurting!
1230;AM006BA;I'll figure out something!
1063;AE105_012;They're attacking us!
4038;AA024Z;The world would be better without them. Let's bring them along to hell!
946;AL017DD;That's great!
1979;AF021BA;If you get too close, the enemy will notice you.
1394;AA058BA;Let's hang out tonight, everyone!
5227;AE163_020;The aliens seem to be communicating with each other, probably requesting backup. Stay alert.
1642;AE128_052;ENEMY LANDING SHIPS!
666;AE010CA;Keep going!
730;AY015DB;I'm back.
1197;AT207DA;We have to save him!
1448;AM128BA;You've gotta be kidding me!
758;AB010DC;Let's fly!
2158;AA029BE;Believe in the headquarters and we will win!
600;AL008V;Clear!
1977;AE157_031;You mean just directly hit the barrier?
1716;AN021BE;Hey! So nice to see you here!
3720;AA141BE;Powered exoskeletons were originally a military technology.
1233;AE147_004;Fire at the drones.
629;AM063BC;Can't do.
3338;AA091DB;I'm surprised that the military would manufacture aerial units.
3431;AE183_010;From now on, the winged aliens will be called Tadpoles.
1156;AE158_020;DIVE!
2164;AA026BA;Even in this situation, I feel hungry.
2782;AA120BD;Being a soldier isn't a special job anymore nowadays.
1884;AA009DD;The sky today is pretty.
1710;AL019BD;We just killed the last one!
1205;AEX04_167;Defend this mountain!
2583;AE123_023;Not just carrying them, they've opened fire!
2011;AE169_014;Giant beta type is annihilated!
947;AM003DA;I'll go save you!
4727;AE166_025;Thick armor and heavy weaponry. They are the natural enemies of ground units.
2124;AD003DD;The enemy is outside the shooting range!
1154;AL025BB;It was the last one, right?
948;AY036DC;I can't believe it.
2602;AE203_007;Do you read me? Why is there no response?
5145;AE111_022;The large flying saucers that deploy monsters will be called teleportation ships from now on.
1359;AE141_096;Any chance to win?
3037;AE210_052;This is number 21! We're getting wiped out!
755;AM047W;Of course!
1069;AL046BD;I survived!
2312;AEX04_185;Hang in there! Backup is on its way!
2736;AA029BB;Believe in the headquarters and we will win.
502;AG008X;Coming!
8457;AE202_029;The war is getting out of hand, but we are still hanging on. The performance of the three submarine carriers have exceeded everyone's expectation.
3704;AQ008DC;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1534;AEX04_014;Enemy also on the right!
1813;AA109BD;Being a soldier is my duty.
1175;AO007CB;Power reload!
1501;AL017BD;And go find other enemies!
2121;AE166_027;The enemy's armor is far too thick!
701;AM083BA;I agree.
3094;AE109_035;There's nowhere safe. Too bad.
1475;AE191_001;Let's go! Keep it up!
1157;AF009DB;Haven't been seen yet.
2198;AE210_036;The giant cannon is no longer operational!
681;AG001ZA;NOW!
817;AE001_053;I see.
1583;AF001BB;The enemy hasn't noticed us yet.
2094;AE140_015;It looks like this is the end!
1209;AO032BD;RELOAD BULLETS!
1417;AL033DC;Okay, let's call it a day.
1731;AC020BD;Remember what I told you yesterday?
870;AEX04_005;Attack now!
2070;AE168_010;The fog is getting thicker! Watch out!
1588;AEX04_555;Excellent! Engage hostiles!
5920;AE148_011;They're walking over the buildings! Are those long legs designed to avoid obstacles and roam free?
336;AB009DC;Yeah!
1802;AS005EC;SAVE ME!
1683;AE174_034;We beat the long-legged!
1842;AJ006X;Sergeant, where are you?
979;AT001BD;AHHH!
2813;AE155_013;Are these webs created by the monsters?
1369;AA013DB;I don't regret anything.
1683;AS016BD;I TAKED OUT THIS GUY!
1232;AM069X;You're always right!
1437;AN014AB;We must work together to win.
3077;AE113_031;Incredible! Are you really a newbie?
996;AM017BD;WE DID IT!
1637;AF008AB;Get prepared before the enemy sees us.
1258;AQ015BC;AAHHHHH!!
6425;AE141_050;Airstrike in three, two, one. Commence airstrike.
1868;AM180BA;Because I have something to protect.
3849;AE144_034;Only a few enemies left! The strategy is really working this time!
1607;AA001ED;AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1549;AI013DC;The wings can't hold any longer!
2675;AE117_012;Move in! The vanguard should be somewhere.
1780;AK005AA;IT'S THE ENEMY'S REINFORCEMENT!
1357;AE151_005;Barbecue time!
3748;AE210_051;The other mother ships want to protect it because it's their command ship.
1289;AC022DD;Now is the time.
1322;AP011BD;I took one down!
2217;AE198_021;Bargain 8 here. I'll give it my best.
1117;AM059AB;Don't be silly!
4839;AE210_039;Yes! This is wonderful news! This is the first time we've damaged a mothership!
1106;AZ014Q;Move over the target.
1600;AEX04_282;CONFIRMED. COLONIST.
1699;AT101AC;Damn! I can't move!
1202;AM068Y;You're a real genius!
2687;AA019V;What matters is not the technique, but the mindset.
1211;AA117BA;That mission is too hard!
2579;AZ028PA;You're an extraordinary man, Air Raider.
571;AM055DC;Can't do.
914;AY015DD;I'm back!
1579;AE055BC;Attacking the enemy now!
1922;AR003DA;Captain! Please respond!
1145;AG010BB;They're coming this way!
2772;AE187_001;Destroy enemy robots and recover the urban area!
627;AH016BA;Are you hurt?
1281;AM183BB;This is for my wife.
1100;AM054DA;I can't do that!
3734;AA031X;I will kill all aliens. Nothing else matters.
672;AM016X;Yes sir!
1668;AE206_013;Number 11 is ascending.
2254;AE043AA;EDF always faces the enemy head-on!
1873;AE121_036;I knew it wouldn't be a cakewalk.
1932;AEX04_099;GARENADE CANNON, FIRE!
1653;AE004_069;THERE ARE ALIENS INSIDE!
1637;AE105_047;What the hell is that device?!
571;AH001W;Watch out!
2461;AO013BC;I'm changing the magazine! Support me!
530;AM030ZA;That's it!
1554;AE001_043;Come, I'll give you a weapon.
1572;AE150_029;The mysterious monster is coming!
1302;AE144_043;The enemy robots?
1298;AL013BB;Exterminate it!
675;AY015BC;I'm back.
993;AE028AB;Who's gonna kill it?
3935;AQ005FB;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2607;AE120_008;Show those monsters what the Spriggans are made of!
3732;AE131_068;Please send in the data of the cave. We will analyse it from here.
769;AC001DB;Go, go!
1946;AA028BA;I wanna eat barbecued meat now!
1492;AL024BB;Victory is ours!
1059;AM004Y;Our man is injured!
1981;AE144_006;THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM!
3279;AE194_002;The Mothership can be left alone. Eliminate everything else.
1268;AN009BD;Let's fight together!
7605;AU021BC;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
4469;AE211_029;Is it ruling over the primers because it's evolved to the highest degree?
1024;AS004ED;Let go!
1595;AD006DA;Asking for permission to attack.
1490;AE124_014;We can't do this anymore!
1604;AA034AB;A brighter future is waiting for us!
1030;AY058DD;I'm sorry.
560;AY049DC;Welcome.
1129;AM057BA;I'll figure out something!
3808;AE127_008;Those tiny monsters have no chance against the Blue Jackets!
1852;AM025BC;This is what the training does!
2351;AC013AC;Positive enemy reaction! Stay sharp!
1682;AR004CA;YOU DARE TO KILL MY MEN?!
1833;AE169_018;King successfully annihilated!
1054;AZ015PB;Gun hatch opened!
2062;AE163_038;KILL THEM BEFORE WE GET SWALLOWED!
5440;AEX04_078;Air raid in 3...2...1...0
242;AP003BE;Hit!
1928;AE174_035;The short-legged deroid destroyed!
1424;AG003X;The fight starts now!
656;AQ009BB;I've been hit!
1814;AE183_022;Flying Objects in sight!
1345;AC010BD;I will take down the enemies.
647;AM081BB;That's right!
1220;AEX04_469;IT'S THE KING!
2246;AA106BB;I was still a security guard until last week.
1908;AF002BA;Looks like the enemy can't find our location.
1016;AM039DD;Sir, yes sir!
6667;AU162X;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We travel our foes day and night
2480;AE176_038;Damn! All of them are difficult to handle!
1300;AM156BE;We'll talk about it later!
2071;AM125BD;YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG!
1449;AE167_014;Destroy the big anchor!
932;AEX04_492;Drones!
1006;AB004AB;FOLLOW ME!
1977;AR010AB;Drop those dead! Defeat the enemy!
1422;AN018BE;Please let me join your team!
2630;AEX04_255;You can look at them any way you want after the fighting's over.
1580;AH004BC;DON'T DIE! STAY ALIVE!
1935;AE146_018;Team B, under attack!
1695;AJ007BA;Aren't the rescue teams here yet?!
1380;AM028CB;Can we wait a little longer?
1096;AK003V;Enemy spotted!
809;AT102CA;I can't move!
4009;AEX04_220;Is it winter already? How long will this war last?
1693;AE210_086;Destroy the nearby cannons first.
1982;AE112_037;I got it! It's all or nothing!
2266;AF021BB;If you get too close, the enemy will notice you.
4879;AE210_007;There's no way back. You have to destroy the mothership. It's now or never. Understood?
1331;AK007BD;NEW ENEMIES APPROACHING!
1876;AE140_033;The no-beads and all the heavy lifting!
2744;AT308BA;Thanks for saving me. Ugh, it's you!
2603;AL001BA;AAAAAAHHHHH!
1256;AM200BC;It's a long story.
1931;AE148_025;Something is coming down from above!
1980;AE113_022;I can't believe they're hiding down there!
1828;AA023DB;Plasma drive, output stable.
954;AM004BD;I'll help you!
918;AL008ZA;E.D.F.
919;AO007DA;Power reload!
1128;AM009BB;DON'T MOVE!
1490;AI009AB;Let's get this job done quickly!
1060;AY007DA;I owe you big!
955;AN023DD;I'll protect you.
2036;AD007DD;Asking permission for flying combat!
4569;AE177_020;It's useless to destroy the spacesuits! We have to hit the aliens inside!
1347;AM107DC;That would be nice.
368;AB007CA;HA!
1966;AC005Z;Remove SPEARS safety devices.
4991;AE183_015;To put it simply, now is the process to see which larvae can make it in this world.
2319;AL021DD;Plasma Drive, energy saving mode.
7852;AE186_007;Start attack phase one. Use powered exoskeletons equipped with surface-to-air missiles to destroy the flying type in the proximity.
8541;AE113_033;We've received reports about two teleportation ships being shot down in New York and three in London. We're gradually seizing the initiative of the war.
4253;AE127_006;We've killed countless monsters with this tactic. These things will be our prey too.
662;AO001AC;Reload!
978;AE158_013;I'M NEXT!
1700;AA004X;Is there any special allowance?
2308;AE103_050;Abandon the base! Evacuate now!
3682;AA024V;Be proud of yourselves wearing the uniform and fulfill your duty!
770;AY035BE;What a bummer.
1672;AV001W;GO SAVE THE ONES CAUGHT IN THE WEB!
2063;AA051BC;I am the best singer!
3989;AE117_027;It'll be too late if they reproduce underground. We have to do something about it!
661;AM049DD;Forget it.
763;AM026Z;Okay!
1071;AY073BD;Not a big deal.
2002;AL026DD;The opponent's got nothing on me!
9749;AE106_017;Third, when a drone is hit, nearby drones will turn into combat mode. That means the drone that was hit will inform the drones around it about the enemy.
354;AM033AB;NO
1245;AE150_002;Commence operation!
1324;AE030V;Shoot! Blazer!
775;AA041DC;Are you shaking?
1372;AK007BC;NEW ENEMY IS APPROACHING!
2531;AE121_056;RUN! IT'S TOO DANGEROUS HERE!
1563;AM199BA;I'll tell you in details later.
801;AM010AA;Good job!
1672;AZ018I;A bombing request from the aerator!
2543;AE199_030;Monsters they're reading the structure
2700;AE104_053;There's so many! The outnumber is tenfold!
703;AE009CA;Finish then!
1795;AE114_013;DO NOT FEAR! STRIKE BACK!
1102;AE105_051;RETREAT!
822;AK008BE;Here's the enemy!
1057;AM036V;I got your back!
1021;AB009BA;They want us to run!
1492;AA039X;The tunnel won't collapse, right?
1518;AE009X;DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME!
1297;AY060DD;I apologize.
6598;AE175_012;Are they professional dairy farmers? I'm impressed that aliens know how to improve the reproductive rate.
1975;AE002_142;Why isn't there any response from the ground force?
1043;AS005EA;SAVE ME!
2665;AA088DD;I feel like I'm assimilated with those bats.
5164;AE211_019;Every alien that we've encountered was armed, except for this giant.
855;AP020BC;You deserve it!
2195;AE197_012;We're surrounded! Damn it!
1676;AS007BD;Somebody help me
2217;AE115_018;Alas gig, count me in!
1345;AEX04_193;DEFEND THE RAILGUN!
1445;AE126_005;Pylons confirmed!
850;AS003EA;WAAH!
2250;AE142_032;MONSTERS EMERGING FROM UNDERGROUND!
1630;AE138_027;Aliens flank to the left and right!
2288;AE186_039;Behind us! It's coming from behind!
2076;AE190_045;The aliens are leading the monsters!
682;AO013DB;Landed!
3143;AE141_110;Fabulous! Now they know what we've got!
996;AP003W;It's defeated!
2700;AEX04_667;This is Panther 1, commencing operation!
1227;AA036DA;We'll return alive.
1718;AI001ZA;Blood? You!
1785;AI007CA;Something's wrong with the stabilizer!
4165;AE159_048;Team 2 is fighting against the flying type! Fail to approach the mountaintop!
1514;AE163_005;JUST KILL THE ENEMIES!
1020;AM165BD;Let me thank you.
2134;AA046DD;Have you been able to contact your family?
508;AE202_070;And?
6766;AU152CB;Why should I still keep on fighting, on shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
2684;AEX04_705;Support vehicles have arrived. They will care for the wounded.
772;AE004W;IS IT DONE?!
688;AM042BE;No problem.
1136;AE023X;Great chance!
888;AI011DA;It hurts!
7666;AU161BC;This city has nothing but despair. All we hear is silence now, cause not a soul was spared.
2702;AZ051G;I penetrated the target! Ha! Superb!
2569;AE116_013;The monsters are taking orders from the aliens!
1498;AE166_011;One more alien remaining!
1701;AA114BE;Isn't this operation kind of messy?
6709;AE125_019;This is Alpha! Aliens ahead! We're engaging the enemy! Huh? The enemy is bombing us!
936;AA062DB;Why are you here?
1035;AE039BC;SWEET!
2129;AE005_038;I never knew you were about to die!!
706;AP009AC;Who's next?
1027;AL015BD;They're all wiped out!
789;AP004Z;Defeated it!
1800;AE119_046;I CAN FIGHT NO MORE!
1359;AQ011BC;The armor is damaged!
1495;AM027BE;YOU DESERVE MY PRAISE!
1457;AG016BA;IT'S SHOWTIME!
2676;AL002X;E.G.F.! E.G.F.!
2540;AT008BE;It uses its thread to capture its prey to eat!
2336;AEX04_578;Ranger unit is nearby. Rendezvous with them.
1410;AG004BD;The enemy is closing in!
1020;AL046BB;I survived!
509;AM062DA;I think so.
6598;AE002_089;This is weird. We're talking about a horde of 10-meter monsters, and no one noticed a thing before the shit hit the fan?
1987;AS001ZA;AHHHHHHHH!!!!
1015;AD006V;Mark the target!
2090;AA059BE;Are you a soy sauce or a ketchup person?
557;AM044AC;Indeed.
2050;AE111_012;What are the aliens trying to do to us?
1397;AE154_011;Mother monster defeated!
4233;AL001W;UuuuuuuuuuuuuuAAAAAAaaaaaux
1492;AR026BD;I WANT REVENGE!
4549;AEX04_723;The transport aircraft will arrive shortly. It will drop the bargain on the battlefield.
575;AB003DD;AHHH!
2972;AE159_054;This is Scout. Monsters are flying out from the nest!
1127;AR021BA;Someone got killed!
1186;AA038X;What is your purpose?
1001;AE133_005;There's water flowing!
3535;AE129_004;The sandstorm is blocking off our field of view. Don't let your guard down.
893;AY040BB;At your service.
984;AM076BE;I would if I could!
1435;AE190_002;Next team, move out!
1200;AM140DA;I've made up my mind.
2238;AT102BC;I'm tangled in the threads and can't move!
3572;AE125_012;Scout to HQ! Enemy artillery unit is closing in!
842;AM005BE;I'll back you up!
2173;AEX04_415;GLOWING MONSTERS!
1364;AL003Z;E-D-F!
520;AM040BB;Yes.
6628;AE183_014;Those larvae had to survive a harsh environment and fierce predators after birth. Only the fittest will survive and grow up.
3007;AZ029QB;This is Carrier. Dropping complete. Get on the vehicle.
2684;AT103DC;I can't move! Help me!
956;AM039DB;Sir, yes sir!
2143;AZ010G;Civilian, show me the enemy's position.
6366;AE104_009;Sergeant, move with tanks. They can block off the acid from the monsters. Once the monsters get close, move with the tanks.
2443;AE103_006;AAAAARGH!
2131;AN006BD;You're only a civilian, but you are brave.
1311;AN007DD;I'll follow your command!
773;AM013AB;You did it!
942;AP003DD;We got one!
1419;AA033CA;Stay focused while flying!
1428;AE131_062;There are aliens here too!
1744;AR005X;YOU DARE TO KILL MY BUNNIES?!
2495;AE002_058;Well done! You seem to have some talent!
3809;AA090DC;Wow, the military equipment is truly advanced.
2206;AJ015BC;Someone give us instructions!
403;AQ002BC;Yay!
650;AL017CA;Is it done?
928;AC002X;I can't wait!
2140;AA060BB;This is not a game, you got that?
3994;AE119_007;Wait! I think I heard something.
2002;AA074DC;I've never been trained to fly underground.
2169;AT304DA;Awesome! You saved my life.
2949;AE202_038;Number 15 to Sentinel-2, please respond!
1144;AC012AC;Check on both sides!
3820;AE207_012;Monsters are approaching the area! They are converging on our location!
1657;AN003CA;Civilian! Let us help you!
763;AM002DD;You all right?
1906;AE004_079;The enemies are coming from the right side!
1927;AK003BA;The scout reports the enemy is sighted.
1898;AE130_004;AAAAAAH!
604;AM032CA;NO!
7601;AU161W;This city has nothing but despair, all we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared.
1674;AE183_025;The winged aliens keep coming!
1227;AS002V;SHOOT HER DEAD!
1507;AA033DB;Shock absorber, normal.
5800;AE166_042;Enemies have landed in North America and China in great number. We might lose most of the strongholds.
2137;AK003BE;The scout reports that the enemy is sighted.
651;AY045DC;Good evening.
1453;AE017AB;Watch out for enemies in the back!
3791;AA027ZA;Let your eyes get used to the dark. Don't crash into your allies.
1084;AM077DD;That's what I heard!
2118;AE033BA;I'M INVINCIBLE!
2044;AA082DC;I should have worked harder on my night flight training.
450;AM033BE;Roger!
1052;AP001W;Hit confirmed!
2379;AE183_029;Grim Reaper, enemy confirmed.
3071;AE114_051;Are they aliens? They look just like humans!
1337;AR032BE;George got chewed up!
1076;AA041BA;I can't fall asleep.
1828;AQ004FB;Ugh! Ah!
1293;AL016AB;And that seems to be the last one.
2718;AF007AC;The enemy is too careless. Now's the best timing.
1774;AA011CB;Save the output of the generator.
1445;AF003DA;The enemy hasn't found us.
1505;AE194_024;I knew you'd make it!
787;AM065BE;That won't work!
3439;AE120_005;The enemy didn't see us. Get close and take them out at once.
734;AE127_002;Ready!
1188;AE173_014;ATTACK THE MONSTERS!
1676;AE141_006;It's from the base!
967;AY064BD;I didn't mean to.
1852;AF033BE;And it also leads to victory!
1533;AE007DB;Let's destroy the target!
1096;AZ014O;Marker captured.
1702;AE017AA;Watch out for the enemies in the back!
6290;AE211_048;This is the wrath of God. Watch it manipulate the elements.
2986;AE141_085;Over 5,000 aliens have been dropped down.
3128;AEX04_669;This is Panther 3, backing up the unit in combat.
681;AP006AC;One down!
1823;AT204CB;It's a trap! Be careful!
1700;AE119_013;How about exoskeletons?
1718;AN006W;Storm One, I'll back you up.
7572;AU021X;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist out here in paradise.
3065;AE104_004;Attack the monsters and stop the disaster from spreading!
875;AY005DC;I'm in your debt.
6650;AU112DD;Deep into the darkness, marching on, We fear no danger, we stay strong!
2391;AE118_012;It's deceptively quick for its size!
1728;AH006AA;Look out for enemies' counter-attack!
819;AP002W;Defeated it!
1301;AE012BE;Don't look down on me!
686;AM056AA;YOU'RE WRONG!
1430;AE168_009;The fog is getting thicker!
1082;AN018DD;Let's go together!
781;AM165BC;Let me thank you.
1727;AA127BE;I can't imagine we will lose!
2491;AE179_014;We're gonna open the blast door. Ready?
5086;AE005_014;The previous airstrike's already immobilized Ergenus. We'll kill it during the next round of attack.
1013;AY075BA;I'm having fun.
2156;AK003AA;The sensor is responding, stay on guard!
1417;AEX04_383;CONFIRMED MONSTERS!
2529;AE107_004;The civilians are in greater danger than we are!
2158;AL050BD;It feels great to come back triumphantly.
2439;AZ043G;Air raiders will always stay above you.
923;AM155BE;Either way!
1046;AL006DA;YEAH!
2366;AEX01_006;Spriggan unit here! We've captured the enemy!
630;AG003CB;Attack!
2408;AE003_018;LOOKS LIKE THE MONSTER'S SPITTING SOMETHING!
2055;AE210_115;You are representing us humans!
888;AE177_011;Aliens here!
2590;AE110_013;You think you can beat us with those weapons?!
492;AM029DA;Roger!
1755;AN008DB;Wing Divers, at your command.
1123;AL036BA;It's finally over.
1535;AG002AB;Now, kill them all!
850;AR013BC;One man died!
579;AY045BE;Good evening.
964;AM212BE;That can't be!
1500;AA041BB;I can't fall asleep.
1230;AEX04_044;Four enemies left!
3111;AA022BC;I'm transferring to the Logistics Division tomorrow, thanks.
460;AD024DC;Ready!
1246;AE129_005;I can't see anything!
1032;AZ011H;Load the ammo!
2214;AE117_017;Why are there monsters underground?
1419;AM044CB;Completely wrong.
1279;AE012W;ATTACK THE HEAD!
2908;AE002_160;Unlike machines, living creatures can reproduce.
3104;AA029X;Now I'm paid double, but I'm not happy at all.
3636;AA132BA;But with a trained body and a powered exoskeleton, it's not a problem.
1205;AS006EA;NOOOOOOOOOOO!
3353;AE211_021;It isn't carrying a weapon. What's going on?
1951;AI014BE;I'll be in trouble if I don't figure it out!
960;AQ006DA;I'M DROPPING!
2381;AE210_030;Direct hit on the giant cannon confirmed!
958;AD011DB;Move closer!
845;AY070BD;Fine by me.
842;AE105_011;Are they enemies?
6973;AU012BE;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
4130;AEX04_668;This is Panther 2, we have arrived on scene, starting operation.
855;AM070DD;Exactly!
4200;AE134_014;We have confirmed a new type of monster that has the ability to fly.
3331;AE154_004;You fought with Mother Monsters before, right? We will count on you!
1577;AE145_037;The enemy's new weapons!
1559;AJ002BA;This situation's terrible!
1170;AE145_041;It's a robot army!
4107;AE128_006;I'm a shooting champion. I'm better than 10 men combined. I'll protect you.
1978;AA081BB;The enemy is hiding in the dark!
938;AL031BD;We're a great team.
2093;AT207BE;Help your allies destroy the web!
614;AM041X;Correct.
1194;AA007Y;Don't we have a battle plan?
1295;AO028BA;SWAMP THE MAGAZINE!
4391;AE108_009;We can't leave the Pylod like that! Destroy it before it causes more casualties!
914;AE012DB;Luck on!
1847;AD019BB;Come here, I'll teach you a lesson!
1894;AE065BE;GAAAAAAAH!
1203;AM152BB;Okay, okay!
1196;AL001DA;AHHH!
2981;AE111_008;TRY TO TAKE OUT THE MONSTERS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS!
6558;AE202_033;The submarine carrier Pandora was sunk. It was hit by multiple cannon shots fired from Mothership No. 8.
940;AY042DC;Nice meeting you.
2179;AE163_056;Recovery team, move fast.
686;AE185_009;BACK OFF!
1588;AJ013BC;We can't fight without a commander!
845;AM015Z;Approved!
3305;AE145_056;And they have advanced equipment. They're difficult to deal with.
2344;AZ004J;This is Bummer, entering the combat area.
2198;AE005_004;And I'll see you in the next video!
1899;AE210_121;Destroy the blue shining cannon!
1684;AE142_035;Monsters coming out from the ground!
1001;AZ011O;Reload power.
3885;AE154_009;GET INTO A BUILDING RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE MOTHER MONSTERS START SPEWING ACID!
1903;AE153_020;THE ENEMY SHIPS ARE COMING!
1171;AEX04_458;THEY'VE GOT WINGS!
802;AP011DD;We did it!
1786;AL014Z;I'm so disappointed.
6862;AU132BC;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
1733;AE197_022;The mothership is dropping anchors!
1357;AE018W;SHOOT IN THE FRONT!
468;AY051DC;Later.
798;AE159_009;Eliminate them.
1262;AM112BA;You're WRONG!
1810;AE195_016;Anchor successfully destroyed!
939;AY006DB;I owe you one.
2363;AT109DD;This is Wing Diver! Request for support!
908;AP007V;GOOD KILL!
1526;AT301DD;Thank you for coming to help!
3907;AE202_009;I'll try and slow him down. Ah ha ha!
2125;AE117_018;Contact! Aliens!
1958;AE181_024;They're getting too close! Fall back!
777;AY023DD;Hahaha
2195;AE211_085;We've initiated Operation Omega.
1991;AL001BE;WAHHHHH!
1563;AR006V;Cover the ones down!
2189;AE107_008;THIS MONSTER CAN SHOOT OUT THREADS!
1343;AA023BA;I have someone to protect.
3089;AA129BD;Only the powered exoskeletons can carry this heavy weapon.
2776;AO019BA;The ammo doesn't come out! The gun's jammed!
2569;AS002ZA;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
2970;AA028W;Being a soldier is awesome. I sincerely think so.
2605;AEX04_577;Ranger unit has arrived on scene. Rendezvous with them.
2293;AS009BD;I'M OVER HERE! SAVE ME!
687;AM044DA;Impossible.
2140;AM071X;Stop making me laugh!
2097;AN028DC;It's a dream to fight together with a hero.
1988;AC017AC;We're in enemy's rage! ALREADY?!
6681;AU112DC;Deep into the darkness, marching on. We fear no danger, we stay strong.
808;AM085BA;That makes sense.
1178;AE186_050;Full alert!
1656;AR015BD;Report! One man died!
4506;AE179_040;No. There's a problem with the crane. That's why it was locked away in the warehouse.
1380;AD002BB;The enemy's closing in!
785;AQ007AC;I've been shot!
2251;AL008AA;E D F
1565;AE169_004;HUGE BASTARD!
2286;AY041BB;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
4068;AE128_049;Jesus Christ! It's remarkable that ground units can hold for this long!
926;AS004EA;LET GO!
1744;AL006X;AHHHHH!!!
879;AE191_025;What are those?
7453;AE141_083;A war of attrition against the aliens. We cannot go back. We can only put in more men and fight to the end.
451;AQ002FD;AHH!
1190;AD010DA;Ready to take off!
2376;AA004BD;I'm confident in my shooting, just count on me.
2188;AA040AB;Think about triumph under all circumstances.
1750;AC012BA;Ready to fight, aren't you?
1631;AE143_070;Recall the troops sent to Europe.
807;AZ007N;Launch!
3006;AE064BD;WHY ISN'T IT DEAD YET?!
1111;AA015V;FOCUS ON THE MISSION!
984;AM132DA;You saved me!
2304;AT007BA;It's pulling me away! Somebody help!
1436;AE153_041;X4, Roger!
1973;AF015BA;I must move in carefully without being spotted.
1893;AA043AC;Exterminate the enemies underground!
1882;AT006AB;GET THOSE THREADS OFF OF ME!
4815;AE109_022;The weapons of the red monsters are their fangs! Shoot them dead before they get closer!
639;AN020BA;Hi, Captain!
1807;AJ005BE;Someone contact the headquarters!
665;AM025V;Give it up!
869;AR016DC;Someone fell!
1972;AE211_008;It doesn't seem to be surrendering.
1595;AJ009DD;We must complete the mission!
1842;AA075DB;So this is the underground wind.
3514;AE192_003;Exterminate the mother monster! And its eggs!
2691;AA120BA;Being a soldier isn't a special job anymore nowadays.
1600;AE180_031;Exterminate the monsters!
3042;AS002EC;Uh ha ha ha! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
1955;AEX04_602;Sniper team, target confirmed.
1025;AE207_004;Drones incoming!
848;AE026BE;No!
1612;AE171_045;Arceilous, moving now!
2264;AE173_003;The city has been overtaken by drones!
1218;AEX04_317;CONFIRMED MONSTER
675;AM014DC;Great!
807;AQ004Y;AHHH!
3241;AA021X;Those aliens are way too diligent. I won't work that hard.
2114;AA025BB;I will barbecue with my kids on the weekend.
1430;AJ002DB;Send backup! Hurry!
4624;AE105_075;The drones split into teams of hundreds. Citizens are in great danger now.
604;AH001Y;Watch out!
2115;AD004Y;The enemy's coming. It's all or nothing.
696;AM155BA;EITHER WAY!
1107;AL013BE;Exterminated!
7783;AU151DB;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
1231;AE013Z;Kill me if you can!
1334;AA007DC;The wind is refreshing.
2358;AA107BD;Because I left the security company to enlist.
1284;AE177_032;Let's go! Let's go!
1209;AO015BD;Where's my magazine?
1017;AA021CA;Do you like to fly?
2631;AE003_006;This is Yoda II, ready to fight some monsters!
871;AM044DD;Impossible!
997;AEX04_727;We're saved!
3762;AE004_011;Air Force strike to the mothership. Countdown, five minutes.
1275;AM076DA;That's common sense!
1225;AT110DA;BREAK THE WEB!
1993;AD007AB;Hold your fire until they get in range.
3052;AE138_015;There's nowhere to hide! We'll get riddled with bullets!
2966;AE115_015;I can escape alone, but I can't leave my friends behind.
2896;AY012BB;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
1285;AK007BA;NEW ENEMY IS APPROACHING!
1922;AE030X;NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATES ALLOWED!
2908;AN006BC;You're only a civilian, but you are brave.
1860;AM146DC;Because I'm too poor to feed myself.
1631;AE143_045;This is a private message.
2739;AF013BB;They didn't even notice us. We are winning.
507;AY045BD;Good evening.
2685;AE107_021;We know. The monsters are everywhere.
984;AM214BE;I can't believe it!
996;AM018BB;I'm impressed!
1183;AR034BE;K got chewed up!
1088;AB003BC;MOVE FORWARD!
460;AY050BE;Goodbye!
3580;AZ005Q;Transport chopper to air raiders, please indicate dropping coordinates of the vehicle.
1342;AE119_016;And the tank's operational!
788;AM020V;APPROVED!
1089;AI007BE;Where's the medic?
927;AG008DD;They found us!
747;AO002W;RELOAD!
1018;AM097BD;That is correct!
1230;AA003EB;SAVE ME!
1513;AE041BA;It's gettin' more interesting!
980;AE012X;How's that?
894;AE211_040;What is that?
1326;AM105DC;Yeah, you're right.
594;AM208BE;Whoa!
653;AM027CB;Next time.
1316;AE133_002;What'll we find?
4882;AA133BD;With a powered exoskeleton, even weak men can be strong, but you must train yourself.
6292;AE202_052;Ten mother ships are advancing. They are targeting the cities and military bases that have remained unscathed.
1091;AL030DC;My work is done.
3324;AL028DB;Of course, I'm blessed by the goddess of victory.
1269;AM092BE;It's common sense.
1066;AH019BC;We're being attacked!
1511;AK006CA;NEW ENEMIES CONFIRMED!
750;AM068DD;Of course!
3183;AA130BC;Thanks to the powered exoskeleton, it feels weightless.
2113;AE176_060;Let's show them what the blazer's got!
1341;AA034DC;I'll cover you from the sky.
1442;AE004_005;Attack the flying saucers!
790;AN003Z;I'll back you up.
1819;AEX04_658;Spriggan unit, commencing attack!
1396;AR022BD;This thing killed my buddy!
4518;AE117_038;This is Spencer. I just sent the location to you. Looks like we covered more ground than anyone else.
2265;AM175BD;Because I'm the ally of justice.
1210;AM162DD;I can't believe it!
2402;AE168_002;We have to do it if the citizens are in harm's way.
1422;AEX04_671;Panther 5, copy that.
1029;AI004AC;Prepare for the worst!
1254;AM094BA;You don't need to point it out.
2145;AN021DB;I will be on your side all the time.
1188;AM060CB;I can't believe this!
1885;AS009BB;I'm over here! Save me!
1018;AR001Y;You must hold on!
1800;AEX04_116;Artillery unit deployed.
731;AE132_021;KEEP GOING!
3663;AE004_036;So they have their own language, just like us.
977;AM138DC;Because I'm a fighter.
1156;AM092BA;It's common sense.
2410;AS006EB;Noooooo!
1557;AA025V;Let's greet our guests!
1941;AE200_003;Charge forward! It's now or never!
2347;AE002_119;Hey, civilian! Come here, quick!
6739;AU012CA;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs, Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
1755;AA035AA;Even though it's painful, you fight!
3246;AE138_012;Let them get a taste of the Requiem Cannon!
1676;AE147_022;MORE DRONES ARE COMING!
2391;AA053AA;Take it easy. Your eyes will get used to the dark.
5009;AE005_060;The
3152;AY012DA;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
1992;AZ028O;All systems running a check sequence.
1511;AM078BB;Let's talk about it later!
6944;AU172AB;Stand shoulder to shoulder now brave friends. We will storm ahead until the end
1099;AR025BC;Bring me a coffin!
1322;AA062BB;Wanna play a word chain game?
968;AM042DC;That's not gonna work.
512;AM028Y;Okay!
691;AH002DD;Dodge!
1246;AE010AC;Concentrate your fire!
646;AM081AA;WHAT THE-
851;AL039BE;Can I get a medal?
2223;AE128_038;Bastards they think they're snipers
1136;AE119_047;I'm out of ammo!
1063;AH008BC;You can't die!
1354;AE008X;Die, you monster!
3532;AE169_006;We must collect related info. Eliminate the enemy at once!
3290;AA031V;We have to protect the Earth because there is only one Earth!
7459;AU011BB;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie
3530;AE198_050;Flying objects confirmed! It's flying-type monsters!
1162;AG011BD;The enemy is here!
3115;AE158_025;So they don't perceive human beings as a threat.
1852;AE022BE;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
1237;AEX04_007;All teams, move in!
2303;AL023DA;I'll take the opportunity to check my system now.
747;AM016AA;Well done!
1968;AE003BA;Αααααααάαααααάααααααάααααα inertia
3073;AR012BB;Our captain died! We need a replacement commander!
850;AY040BE;At your service.
1586;AN017AA;Looks like we have to fight together.
788;AY038BD;Greetings!
985;AY075DC;I'm having fun.
2828;AZ003Q;This is Transport Shopper. We'll head for the combat area again.
1686;AC017BD;Don't die! Stay alive!
3102;AL002Y;E-D-F! E-D-F!
7563;AU131AB;Fight deep down into the deepest caves, Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
1192;AE040AA;WATCH OUT FROM BEHIND!
2367;AE144_008;Finish the monsters with surface-to-air missiles!
1329;AT105AB;Someone give me a hand!
1731;AE131_024;The aliens seem to like it here.
603;AP003AA;HIT!
1842;AC017BC;Don't die, stay alive!
1306;AL028BC;The enemy is finished!
1778;AC025DC;Ha! Take this!
6834;AU132V;Please don't send us on these grave missions, we're done with these expeditions!
600;AM048AB;That's right!
356;AM026AC;Yeah.
1502;AH005AA;Be careful of the attacks!
3579;AE127_014;You'll be in trouble if they get too close! Attack their feet to slow them down!
901;AN019DC;Take me with you.
7057;AE125_008;The enemy weapons may be powerful, but they are designed for long-range support. We have a chance if we can get real close. Move in!
2389;AE113_038;He's talking about that massive thing, right?
1604;AG005BE;The enemy is coming this way!
1823;AE190_014;ATTACK THE ALIENS!
1003;AL007CA;We made it!
2137;AE138_034;Grim Reaper, show them what you've got!
3590;AA054BB;You didn't expect to do such a cool thing as protecting the Earth, did you?
1135;AO003AA;Reloading!
1321;AE013BB;WATCH THIS!
929;AY039DC;All yours.
708;AQ004DA;I'm hit!
2803;AEX04_547;Three have been killed! That acid is dangerous!
991;AM002BC;Everything alright?
1611;AM139DD;We can never let go of the enemy.
4337;AE202_042;This is F3. Sentinel-2 has been neutralized. Return to F3.
936;AM174BB;Let me thank you!
2581;AM144DD;Because the sky is so blue and beautiful.
19810;AE197_033;Those who are aware of the Primer's existence have assembled the best of the best of each nation to found a global military organization. The brightest minds on Earth have been put together to develop the most powerful weaponry we've ever seen. Numerous outposts have also been set up around the world, each deployed with a huge arsenal.
3271;AE165_008;Teleportation ships, continue dropping off the species gamma!
1983;AE048BA;NOW! ATTACK ITS RIGHT SIDE!
1607;AK009DB;There seems to be something nearby.

1479;AM166BC;Anything you want, my treat.
3034;AE194_015;Gigantic Unloader Barga, attack the mothership!

2364;AA137BB;FENCERS ARE THE STRONGEST SOLDIERS!
7695;AU141DB;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
2285;AN016AC;We're responsible for your safety. Let's move.
1294;AM198BE;I didn't really think it through.
910;AA035BA;Get fired up!
1739;AE131_069;Is this the end of the cave?
1097;AE010X;YOU ASKED FOR IT!
1721;AE003BE;GAAAAAAH!
845;AP006Z;Is it dead?
1028;AI015DB;I think I'm done!
2417;AE210_070;AAAAAAHHHH!!!
1523;AK004DD;Enemy reaction detected!
2701;AEX04_526;Monsters are being dropped from the teleportation ships!
1929;AE148_003;ARE THOSE ENEMY MOBILE WEAPONS?!
375;AM037BA;Sure!
1214;AA073BB;It's so dark.
1771;AE210_061;Ground units, attack those cannons!
2259;AEX04_325;CONFIRMED! GOLDEN SPECIES ALPHA!
1395;AM085DB;Stop the nonsense.
846;AA062DA;Why are you here?
2193;AN003V;It's our job to protect civilians.
833;AM082BE;I think so too.
832;AK014BA;NEW ENEMY!
1831;AE021BD;This weapon is effective!
1497;AL022DA;I must save the energy.
2013;AI019BC;Damn, it's painful!
1310;AN018BA;Please let me join your team.
1627;AK020BB;Enemy responses spotted!
1918;AE125_005;Approach the enemy artillery unit!
1045;AM183BA;This is for my wife.
1731;AN024DA;I'll protect you, that's my task.
1275;AE010V;STAY STRONG!
2126;AE002_133;I'm opening the blast door now!
1140;AO011CA;Ready for cool down!
639;AO001DA;Charge!
1346;AO004X;Swap magazines!
1033;AO029BC;Change the cartridge!
752;AM072DB;That's right!
7627;AU161DB;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
821;AP013BB;I DEFEATED IT!
2135;AQ008AC;GAAAAAAH!
7532;AU011AC;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry! We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie!
2673;AN029BA;Is it really okay to let a guy like you be our captain?
1103;AT207DC;We have to save him!
2243;AD014DD;I'll shoot you dead once you get into range.
1552;AK010BE;Hey, we've got a job to do!
469;AY037DA;Hi.
1466;AK010DC;Looks like there's something approaching.
2849;AE115_014;They will find us sooner or later, so we have to do it.
1200;AA035DC;Let's do this together!
1280;AM156BC;We'll talk about it later!
3117;AA091DA;I'm surprised that the military would manufacture aerial units.
733;AH020BD;WE'RE HIT!
1645;AE002_087;This way! Follow me!
1495;AE141_044;No! Not all of them!
2442;AE002_053;We have to fight for survival! Let's do it!
558;AE039BE;Sweet!
2835;AE198_048;OOOOOOOO
1113;AL015V;All wiped out.
2118;AEX04_544;Contact! Enemy coming from the west!
1160;AG001BA;LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FOUND!
10822;AE202_071;The god that arrived on Earth in an egg-like ship might be an alien. For all I know, he might be a king or a queen if we can defeat him.
598;AM056AC;You're wrong!
1483;AM100BB;That goes without saying!
2308;AE163_022;The sky is covered in black dots!
2355;AA017CB;If you keep moving, you won't get hit easily.
2232;AE210_062;We cannot let it get away! Destroy it!
2916;AE145_032;This is Scout. The mothership is dropping off something.
2863;AE107_014;The monsters are too strong! Let's back off!
2225;AZ028G;One hundred fifty millimeter cannon, fire!
1192;AT005CA;I am stuck in the web!
6776;AE005_042;Don't forget to tell me that where you were a few years ago... And make sure you give this video a thumbs up!
1553;AA025X;I am the invincible hero!
1289;AM103BA;That's written in the books!
844;AB002CB;FOLLOW ME!
2028;AR011BE;Captain! I won't forget you!
1853;AT002CA;I can't fly! Support me!
947;AA037X;Why are you here?
1464;AE117_006;Fire at the monsters!
1700;AA096BB;I want to breathe the air outside.
1578;AEX04_345;CONFIRMED! COLONIST!
901;AM013BD;You're great!
570;AH002AB;HOLD ON!
1721;AI018BB;It's hurting. I'm done.
1304;AN022DD;I'll follow your instruction.
2637;AE168_005;Very risky flying in this fog. Oh, be careful.
1176;AE124_007;IT'S THE ENEMY!
4966;AE002_153;The rescue team must be waiting on the surface. We'll be safe once we get out from here.
1599;AL005BB;YEAH!
1359;AA004ZA;Be careful on the left!
1737;AA037AA;NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER!
3488;AE166_028;Ah, their armor is too thick! Our attacks are ineffective!
2098;AL009BA;AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
1268;AM040V;JUST THINK AGAIN!
2198;AA023Z;Let's send them to hell ahead of us!
1095;AT201DB;Allies got stuck!
785;AS006FD;Help!
2026;AR004X;Crap! How dare you!
799;AM064BE;Not possible.
3579;AE114_002;Yeah, and it's number nine. The ninth one out of 10.
1989;AF004BB;It looks like the enemy can't see us.
2916;AE004_058;Something is landing! Looks like robots!
1219;AI010BE;I need help!
2072;AA031W;I'll prove that their ways are wrong.
1563;AEX04_491;Drones in the air!
519;AM088X;Really?
757;AM042W;Of course!
532;AY037DB;Hi!
1534;AH012BB;We'll give you some medicine later!
1268;AR042BE;I'LL REVENGE!
2314;AE190_015;Secure the powered exoskeletons!
1877;AC008BD;We are almost in the enemy's range.
977;AC004AC;Prepare for battle!
2392;AE113_003;It seems that the evacuation isn't complete yet.
1635;AEX01_007;Is that the Spriggan unit?
3189;AF003V;Let's get close to the enemy. Be careful not to be noticed.
1216;AE117_021;MORE ALIENS!
3690;AE157_010;Unable to see ahead, this heavy fog works against us!
1693;AE150_021;Teleportation ship is down!
4131;AE156_001;We can't reach the wing divers who went to deal with Araneas. Go for rescue immediately.
726;AY015BE;I'm back!
2929;AE140_038;Storm? That's gonna be your name.
1036;AD013BA;It's too far to shoot!
1328;AD008BD;INCOMING!
1162;AM154BB;I have to believe that!
712;AM027CA;Next time.
4916;AE155_012;And plans to trap those men on the web and EAT THEM AFTERWARDS!
1627;AD005CB;The enemy is outside the range!
1233;AE117_042;MONSTERS!
1116;AA004EA;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1239;AM150BE;Alright, I got it!
529;AM039AB;WAIT!
2318;AO021BE;The magazine is empty. What should I do?
4434;AE202_090;We will never give up hope, even to the end. That's our duty.
1691;AE113_027;Monsters are coming to the surface!
1947;AE142_031;In other words, we're doomed!
948;AR007CA;Someone's down!
555;AM031BE;Yes sir!
662;AM036BC;Sounds good.
892;AE012DA;VOC ON!
7261;AU172DC;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
496;AM046BD;YES
1678;AS001X;AHHHHHHH!
2061;AE210_046;AAAAAAAHHH!
1717;AA083BC;We are not lost, are we?
1992;AT103AA;This is bad, at this rate!
1213;AA003FA;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2128;AE105_023;T-T-THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM!
1531;AA007BB;I never lose.
922;AEX04_203;Defend the tank!
942;AE152_009;Who's next?
1592;AE138_021;Monsters approaching!
13744;AE117_045;A new extraterrestrial species has been confirmed. It is a larger species compared to species alpha and species beta. It's approximately 70 metres long. And it's the largest alien creature we have ever seen so far.
6797;AU162DA;Yet, we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
975;AS002AB;Let go!
713;AE108_002;Move in!
2921;AE168_038;AFE is approaching! Go join forces with AFE!
1983;AE114_012;INCOMING DRONES!
289;AZ021J;GO
2417;AEX03_002;Teleportation anchor is covered by webs!
540;AY052BE;Bye-bye!
1583;AK010DA;Looks like there's something approaching!
965;AM016W;Understood.
2291;AN015AC;The top priority of this team is to support you.
1655;AG017BA;FIRE! FIRE!
538;AZ024G;FIRE!
767;AEX04_142;Take aim!
1362;AC002BB;I'll fight with you, Captain!
1375;AM087BC;I knew this was the case.
2913;AE110_035;We have to bring our A-game just to kill the monsters!
1627;AA046BD;I was a cook before I enlisted.
842;AE027V;Ha!
1277;AF005BE;The enemy didn't see us.
751;AZ020PA;LAUNCH!
1454;AE131_018;So they live in the monster's nest?
8464;AEX03_004;Seems like the aliens in the area are transporting Araneas. If they start to multiply, all hell will break loose. We have to exterminate them now!
1623;AL029DC;I must prepare for the next battle.
1295;AE133_011;KILL THE ALIENS!
2137;AI015BD;Damn, I feel dizzy.
3352;AE111_045;Someone just saw monsters! Where should we evacuate?
796;AM014AC;AMAZING!
1731;AA091BB;It feels like a ghost might come out.
931;AM016ZA;I can't approve.
7446;AU011BC;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry! We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie!
1531;AZ003N;Co-ordinates confirmed.
997;AE185_014;I heard something!
705;AH002BA;DODGE!
2431;AS011BD;Let go of me! Let go of me!
1989;AE197_018;We've engaged multiple monsters!
2434;AE206_026;Gone one! Thanks for the support!
2617;AL010CB;E.D.F.! E.D.F.!
2608;AA124BD;They shouldn't have run into us. Tough luck for them.
1126;AM163DC;That's ridiculous!
473;AM038BD;Okay.
1682;AE193_004;IT'S THE GAMMA SPECIES!
1467;AE002_069;Fire! Fire!
1845;AE164_030;Grim Reaper, breaking through.
1422;AE038BD;IT'S SHOWTIME!
3431;AE131_045;Haha, looks like you got the short end of the stick again.
1543;AH007DD;Check if there's any damage!
1299;AA001BC;Show them our strength.
1638;AEX04_351;Teleportation ship found!
610;AM015AC;THAT'S IT!
1105;AE010W;I'll take care of it!
1330;AE165_005;AHHHHHHH!
1642;AE146_009;Oh no! They saw us!
1368;AM111BB;It only seems like that.
1211;AM066Y;Are you sleep talking?
3340;AE162_025;Fire at Arcellus! We can't let it escape unharmed!
1114;AM093DD;Don't tell anyone!
3516;AE207_008;They're everywhere I look. This is hilarious.
766;AE143_048;What do you mean?
1276;AM101DA;Get your facts straight!
720;AB002Y;Straight ahead!
7666;AU111AA;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
801;AM170BB;Thank you!
1614;AR005BD;Captain, hold on!
874;AY015BD;I'm back!
1672;AL018BB;It was the last one remaining!
1527;AE176_001;Ugh, what terrible weather.
872;AE030BA;Leave it to me!
2091;AE109_002;We can all get a rest once we get there.
905;AL011CA;E-D-F!
1974;AE131_048;Good. Rendezvous with the Vanguard.
1051;AG007W;THEY FOUND US!
803;AF006Z;Go stealth.
812;AM070DA;Exactly!
1329;AEX04_025;Enemy confirmed ahead!
1776;AL007AB;EDF! EDF!
2012;AT106BC;I can't get out, I can't!
2700;AE141_100;Operation Crossroad is about to begin.
1150;AM038Y;Easy for you to say!
945;AA020AB;Don't let your guard down.
1167;AE132_019;START FIGHTING!
909;AL004CA;E-D-F!
861;AY003BE;Let me thank you.
1978;AE002_078;Forget it! Let's get out of here!
2285;AE190_018;We'll take care of the ones that get too close!
1625;AA008AB;Kick out those illegal intruders!
705;AM049DB;Forget it.
2219;AE176_025;Infantry unit! AFV is approaching the enemy!
1002;AB002AB;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
7722;AU151DD;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
3343;AE123_012;Citizens are still evacuating. Suppress the aliens in this area.
1209;AQ007DC;Aaaaaaah
792;AM167BE;I'm in your debt.
2116;AE126_007;Monsters are appearing from the pylons!
984;AM071BA;That's impossible!
1726;AJ013BA;We can't fight without a commander!
1492;AE141_015;The aliens are coming this way!
2858;AA093BA;Thinking that the enemy is in the dark makes me get cold feet.
512;AM056BD;YES!
981;AE203_009;Requesting backup!
1174;AM054W;JUST THINK ABOUT IT!
1454;AZ017I;It's a request from the aerator!
1595;AF004BA;It looks like the enemy can't see us.
2173;AT006BE;I'M STUCK IN THE WEB! HELP ME!
7261;AE210_067;Once we destroy that ship, all the sacrifices will be... We... We have to destroy it!
6698;AU022CA;To defend the dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
1181;AD021BB;I'll show it to you!
2140;AE130_006;Back off, or we'll get crushed too!
2198;AR038BC;My- My buddy is dead!
1045;AF025BB;Can we attack now?
429;AQ007BC;CRAP
846;AY044BA;Hello.
1768;AE113_008;Civilians are coming our way!
1761;AS005DD;Let me down!
2885;AEX04_300;CONFIRMED mysterious monster urginous
1210;AE185_019;THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM!
1151;AH004AB;PROTECT THE INJURED!
775;AM164DC;What's going on?
763;AE100_033;You passed.
798;AM135DA;Thanks for the help!
1233;AE211_136;That's our best shot!
5896;AE128_015;Evacuation is not complete yet. There are defenseless civilians behind. We have to shield them off from the enemy.
2383;AE103_040;Take down all of the monsters! Spare no one!
2057;AE158_001;Confirmed to be enemy's new weapons!
1064;AE008AC;FEAT THE BULLETS!
719;AM072AB;Are you sure?
2523;AE014AB;We won't lose if we go by our training. Shoot!
937;AL012V;We did it!
1522;AA091BA;Feels like a ghost might come out.
1475;AE001_007;Let's check the procedures then.
613;AM054X;That's weird.
758;AN011BE;I'll defend you.
1270;AA067DD;What's your purpose?
7614;AU111Y;Now we will invade the underground, wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one.
2423;AS012BD;LET ME DOWN!
683;AM159DA;No way.
6744;AU012W;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
1000;AL015BE;All wiped out!
626;AM007BE;Don't give up!
1787;AEX04_498;Type 2 drones incoming!
1171;AT111BA;DESTROY THE WEB!
3257;AA128BE;How can we lose with such powerful, heavy armaments?
887;AO008Y;Is the gun jammed?
662;AY068DC;It's all right.
1581;AB003X;Hey, let's walk!
1853;AT304AC;I'm finally out. Thank you.
2095;AEX02_035;I love you. Now get out of here!
1493;AA080DA;Watch out for the altitude!
1527;AF005CB;The enemy can't catch us.
9609;AE115_005;But they have ears too. They can hear our footsteps and the sounds created by our equipment. So if we are too close, they will still notice us.
2703;AE114_062;Those bastards! Move in!
2309;AE003_003;They'll freak out when they hear the monsters are all dead.
1607;AEX04_471;Careful of the king's threads!
1048;AM056DA;That won't work!
1293;AY065DB;I will never do that again.
2656;AE147_021;Whoa! Their equipment is really something!
2396;AEX04_385;This is Scout. Monsters are coming!
715;AA069BE;Do you regret?
1083;AY017BA;Easy peasy.
1443;AM129BC;Confirm once again!
2329;AE176_019;You seem to have fun. Count us in!
2422;AN020AA;I've heard rumors about you. We'll give you a hand.
3082;AR003Z;You knew this was coming, right? I'll avenge you.
488;AE203_011;Damn it!
1311;AB012BA;I'm tired already!
3069;AE211_035;Aliens are appearing out of thin air? How is that possible?
2213;AEX04_549;TOO MANY ENEMIES, NEED BACKUP!
1387;AY008DB;I'm so grateful.
1102;AR020BA;An ally is down!
860;AL010AC;Exterminate it!
1721;AM145BD;You read too many comic books.
2615;AN001AA;A civilian? Alright, I'll protect you.
1684;AEX04_275;Confirmed. Drone.
2599;AT103DB;I can't move! Help me!
641;AM043CA;WRONG
1798;AI009DD;An error in the flight system?
1496;AR037BA;Ray got chewed up!
1005;AB001AC;MOVE FORWARD!
1292;AE116_003;Head to the ground, hurry!
1461;AS014BE;I DON'T WANNA DIE!
1339;AA006DC;Flying is my job!
1364;AC025DD;Huh, take this!
710;AM157DC;Do you mean it?
1296;AE184_007;This nest is enormous!
2426;AZ028J;The attack is over. You're on your own from now on.
2979;AE002_146;You've got what it takes to be a soldier. You wanna join us?
1297;AE186_049;WE'RE SURROUNDED!
1331;AM093DB;Don't tell anyone.
1480;AT108DA;I'm caught in the web!
2673;AA002BB;This is why I became a soldier. Leave it to me.
912;AG005CA;You're great!
837;AM080DD;No!
1007;AE164_001;Commence operation.
3041;AQ015BB;AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!
1110;AE005_035;Enemy confirmed!
3430;AE111_040;Pull it together! We will be okay after we defeat the monsters!
600;AH001BB;Watch out!
694;AM041V;Thank you.
2829;AE198_042;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1092;AP012BD;IT'S FINISHED!
1685;AE004_077;Those aliens know teamwork!
1892;AEX04_463;Watch out for the mother monster's acid!
1306;AY003DD;I want to thank you!
7995;AE109_026;The EDF headquarters are on lockdown after declaring emergency. Protesters who are against this decision are confronting the police.
1194;AR008AC;Cover the ones down!
1502;AEX04_587;Shotgunners charging in.
1387;AE170_006;The sergeant is on this track.
2150;AEX04_103;Gullverin Cannon, open fire!
1831;AE168_007;I can't see a thing in this fog!
1086;AM139BE;That's the rumor!
957;AN016BA;I'll help do the mission.
1238;AN015BC;All yours, Captain.
1696;AL033BC;We took down all enemies!
1249;AR021DB;WE MUST REVENGE!
1949;AE168_013;I can't see a thing in this fog!
940;AY055BC;I'm going to sleep.
1809;AA062AA;Don't lose to infantry, got that?
621;AM021AC;You're good.
4949;AA021BA;I applied to join logistics support missions. Maybe this is my last time on the front line.
1517;AF024BE;Still no signal to attack?
1786;AM072BE;You can't meet those expectations!
1795;AE190_007;On the double! Secure that area!
1028;AM022DC;That's amazing!
1974;AE158_035;Shield Bearer, destroyed.
2145;AF015DA;Do not fire before the captain gives the order.
1137;AP025BD;Took care of one!
1104;AI005CA;I'm about to crash!
7549;AU031W;High up in the air, our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
3311;AE002_009;The monsters are still close by, I can't believe it.
1803;AE177_014;I'll take it up with the brass!
2213;AE065BA;LLLLLLLLLllllllllllll
1690;AE107_001;It doesn't seem safe here.
2185;AE152_010;This is Bird1, engaging hostiles!
987;AH025BA;Are you alright, Captain?
2365;AA072DD;I can't believe we need to fly underground.
1853;AE168_001;Monsters are lurking in the dense fog!
1425;AEX04_206;Defend the support vehicle!
934;AB005CA;THIS WAY!
1091;AH007BC;I won't let you die!
2163;AE178_024;SHOOT DOWN THE TELEPORTATION SHIPS!
2542;AE181_011;We're out of options. We're counting on you.
2639;AZ035Q;You'll surely make it through with this. Good luck.
1544;AM072BA;I can't meet those expectations!
6815;AU132DD;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
1966;AE160_005;How come they'd approve this operation?
2722;AA038V;There are enemies hiding around. Stay focused!
1484;AE171_029;The big one is coming!
787;AY059DA;Pardon me.
2840;AE157_009;The fog is too dense! We can't see nothin'!
1329;AM003W;I'll bring the medical team!
2883;AE104_052;This is Eagle One, we're being attacked by UFOs!
1100;AE198_074;Dispatch Team B!
3930;AE002_149;The rescue team should have been here by now. What the hell is going on?
1331;AM071DD;You're absolutely right!
956;AEX04_473;ALIENS!
2299;AE004_030;Are they aliens? They look like humans!
1350;AC010BC;I'll take down the enemies.
2785;AA088BA;I didn't expect to really go on an underground adventure.
1035;AM108DC;No worries.
1498;AN024AB;So, it's you.
600;AM075DC;You bet!
813;AM162BD;I'm grateful.
4173;AE202_049;I'm sorry, I will return to F3.
934;AE033AB;More to the left!
1905;AT108BE;I'm caught in the web! Rescue me!
5346;AE137_022;What we are witnessing now is the alien army. A large scale invasion seems to be underway.
1441;AL038BE;I would like to take a rest.
2582;AE002_103;Maybe think about how you're gonna survive first!
1968;AE211_010;Its arms are starting to radiate!
507;AQ003X;Ugh!
1196;AD014BA;Still out of range.
2978;AE144_032;Enemies are decreasing in number! We're about to succeed!
1203;AM095DD;That's not true!
1599;AC004DA;SENSORS DETECTING ENEMIES!
1935;AQ004EB;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1705;AA029CB;Enjoy flying into the night.
1188;AE034AC;I'LL LEAVE THE RIGHT TO YOU!
1462;AE002_012;The elevator is this way.
1578;AA029DB;Flight system all checked.
1691;AL019BE;We just killed the last one!
6259;AE108_019;I'm totally fine with it. I saw the flying saucers with my own eyes, so I have to accept it.
1403;AM190BA;Because I want money and fame!
1927;AA002EE;AAAAAAAHHHHH current Covid-19
628;AQ004V;AHHH!
1428;AK006X;We've got more work to do!
995;AY033BD;I'm disappointed.
1840;AT201BB;Oh no! Someone is caught!
2529;AZ003K;Confirmed target entering the combat area.
1608;AI003DD;I failed to increase output!
1867;AK005CA;Something's wrong. Enemies!
905;AE031BB;I'll take care of it!
3118;AA016X;There was a time I thought fighting on battlefields was the best.
3290;AE203_017;I can't believe you shot down a teleportation ship.
1114;AE164_024;Attack the drones!
897;AY068DD;It's all right.
505;AM155DA;Really?
1885;AT107BC;Damn! I can't move!
4633;AE132_034;We've lost a lot of good men along the way, but we will complete the mission no matter the cost.
1053;AE143_010;It's always the same!
1039;AE112_033;IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!
1739;AA034AC;A brighter future is waiting for us!
833;AY028BA;That's funny.
1408;AE199_009;Fire! Fire!
1002;AH004DC;I'll go help the injured!
2729;AF005V;Move to a better position before the enemy finds us.
3667;AE002_044;As long as we have powered exoskeletons, we won't lose to those monsters.
775;AA018AC;Reload, now!
2302;AE180_008;Are the aliens trying to reclaim this place?
1876;AM025BE;This is what the training does!
1418;AE011BE;Die, you monster!
778;AN023DA;Protect you.
1581;AM156BB;We'll talk about it later!
1031;AM015BB;Nice!
1940;AB013BE;I told you, I can't run anymore!
1357;AM091BD;It's also written in the books.
894;AO002DD;Reload!
633;AM046BC;YES!
2601;AM195BD;That's the answer I get after seeking what I want.
1529;AK006BD;The scout has spotted the enemy!
5365;AE128_021;The enemy wants to break through, but we won't allow that to happen. They shall not pass!
3120;AA103BE;I want to be a hero, but looks like I can't be one.
494;AEX04_143;Fire!
1287;AI022BA;No way I'll die.
659;AG004DC;We're found!
1365;AE163_028;They do have wings!
2180;AZ015K;Now you know how strong Phobos is!
1632;AQ004FC;WAAAAAAAAOOcher
1604;AD020DD;Flying combat, ready!
1925;AE163_047;Yes! This should teach him!
986;AM001DD;Hang in there!
1515;AR020BB;An ally is down!
33820;AE111_046;This is a war situation report. Looking at the big picture, we have the upper hand. Although aliens keep dropping monsters, the EDF has exterminated more than half of them, suppressing the threat from the enemy successfully. Furthermore, the EDF has announced the development of a new weapon, which will be able to turn the tides of war. The new weapon will be completed in two months and will be deployed in all areas in four months. It will be able to destroy large flying saucers, so it will give us a chance to defeat the alien armada.
7768;AE128_058;The operation was a success. We have stopped the enemy and protected the citizens. Well done. The victory is ours.
1518;AO004BA;I'LL SWAP MY MAGAZINES!
1298;AE148_001;Look at that!
1494;AM185BC;This is for revenge.
1573;AE137_013;Destroy the teleportation ship!
1138;AP013BA;Defeated it!
1521;AF007CA;Take aim at the enemies now!
2104;AE141_061;It's risky, but we have no choice.
646;AE141_071;We did it!
1567;AM111BC;It only seems like that.
884;AL037BB;That's enough.
829;AY039DB;All yours.
6447;AE211_039;It's immortal, omnipotent. Now I know why it was named God in the past.
480;AM033BB;Roger!
4016;AEX04_655;Grim Reaper, this is why you're here. Now show us what you've got!
348;AM041DA;NO
781;AA015AA;Don't let up.
1227;AE198_057;This isn't happening!
2142;AF017BB;Lower your voice or they will find us.
1022;AA004FD;HELP ME!
1138;AM148DC;I want to be an idol.
2372;AY041BC;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
2397;AE190_028;The Air Force will launch another air raid.
812;AC003Y;Weapons are checked.
1661;AR015BC;Report! One man died!
902;AM049BC;SIR YES SIR
1850;AE131_057;No casualties at all on our way here.
384;AE144_039;What?
1640;AD010BD;Let's do it! Don't miss!
1508;AE211_108;Accept this truth.
1025;AM119BD;Just you wait.
2678;AE165_001;The teleportation ships are dropping off the species' gamma!
3361;AE147_039;It looks like they're determined to end the human race.
976;AC027DD;Party time!
2045;AE118_031;Bastards we lost the tank
1850;AL001BD;AHHHHHHHHH!!!!
2850;AE185_003;It's species gamma! It's species gamma!
1290;AS003BC;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
1258;AE028BA;Watch out, buddy!
1816;AE006_002;Good. Destroy the mothership.
726;AM059Y;I've heard about it.
1436;AC026BE;I'm the ultimate soldier!
5959;AE119_061;The air raid made it in time. Although we suffered heavy casualties, we saved several survivors.
1507;AN029DD;I-Is it really you?
1408;AM069DD;You don't have to tell me.
2676;AEX04_070;Fighters are going to attack any second. Watch out!
1091;AE145_009;What do they really want?
1648;AD015AA;CONFIRMED DISTANCE WITH THE ENEMY!
1118;AK001AC;There's the reinforcement!
1901;AH008AB;Don't die. I'll get you home alive.
5910;AE121_065;Oh no. If we let those drones chase us, the city will suffer heavy casualties.
787;AEX04_127;Target hit.
1804;AY013BC;Thank you, I love you.
1081;AL012BD;Mission Cleared!
2761;AE141_046;Ground Force, destroy the remaining cannons at once.
1785;AE122_015;It's no use! Retreat!
3111;AE143_044;Good job! We stopped the alien attack once again!
485;AM123DA;Thank you.
1408;AE150_030;Our attacks are ineffective!
691;AK011DB;AGAIN?!
1634;AO008AC;Cover me while I finish reloading!
1649;AR011DD;One wing diver is behind!
1414;AEX04_397;The red ones are coming!
1845;AE210_091;NOOOOOOO!
2171;AL006AC;Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!
1349;AM084DA;You're not helping at all.
5779;AE121_068;If we don't shoot down all of the drones, they will cause a lot of damage. Shoot down all drones!
1884;AL044BB;I'm hurt. Can I go home?
2678;AEX04_270;CONFIRMED. MUTATED SPECIES GAMMA.
1311;AE145_061;THEY ARE DECOYS!
1675;AA014DA;Watch me dance like a bird!
1905;AI006BA;Oh no! We need healing!
5351;AE114_070;This is Delta Team! The enemy's trying to outmaneuver us! They're trained military soldiers!
1603;AA030CB;Be careful about the altitude.
1139;AC012BC;Ready to fight, aren't you?
1599;AR004ZA;Got killed, crap.
1835;AE194_006;Imperial Drones confirmed!
2726;AE127_020;Calm down! Take them down one by one!
950;AQ005CB;I GOT SHOT!
1942;AA123BD;Let's scare the enemy to death!
1825;AE178_039;Stop fighting! We're in this together!
1498;AE042AB;We will defend humankind!
866;AA009AB;We won't lose.
1552;AEX04_318;Confirmed species alpha.
3820;AE105_002;There aren't any safe places anymore. Not on Earth, at least.
1861;AE045AC;Don't ever expect us to surrender!
1984;AE114_011;More flying saucers than expected!
1537;AM073BB;NOT POSSIBLE!
801;AT202CA;Some got caught!
1084;AM003BB;I'm coming to help!
1285;AM066CA;That's insane!
1264;AR001CA;I'll take my revenge!
1450;AA051DD;I have a smart brain.
1689;AE112_001;It suits you, comrade!
1080;AM071DB;You're absolutely right!
4168;AEX04_401;The red one doesn't spit acid! Keep your distance and you'll get the upper hand!
2284;AE131_005;It'll call for backup if you're too slow!
1997;AZ015L;Submerge before the enemy locks on us!
1377;AL025CA;You're quite good at flying.
1167;AK002DB;Enemy confirmed!
4501;AZ037J;You aren't a soldier. That's the Military Air Raid Request Code.
1828;AEX04_428;What kind of monster is that?!
1531;AEX04_679;Cooker One, no problem!
509;AM121BC;WRONG!
1518;AE163_009;Team 2, spread to the right.
945;AM073AA;That can't be!
6992;AE139_025;Sergeant bad news. There are countless monsters approaching. This is probably the enemy's meeting point
1434;AL038BB;I'd like to take a rest.
1555;AE158_039;Eliminate the remaining enemies.
1405;AE008CB;Take this guy down!
2789;AA004BA;I'm confident of my shooting. Just count on me.
1994;AO006AA;Out of bullets! Reloading!
2274;AE104_008;I see. We will join the fight.
957;AM053AA;That's not true.
542;AU001ZA;Gah!
14076;AE197_029;Yes, they have. Indian mythology tells of a golden ship dropping from the sky. People referred to the golden ship as Vimana and drew paintings of it. And it looks almost identical to alien teleportation ships.
2659;AM065X;Heh. Stop making me laugh.
700;AO002DB;Reload!
2488;AE140_002;I'll take all the enemies I can with me!
2536;AE108_004;Sergeant, pylons are being dropped from the sky.
1284;AEX04_163;Defend this area!
2402;AE154_005;THE ALIENS HAVE BROUGHT ALONG THE MOTHER MONSTER!
3007;AE148_027;Robots are being dropped to the ground! There's a lot of them!
1047;AN011AB;My team will join you.
1844;AI017DB;Today is really not my day!
1759;AE129_059;It's not the time for demolition!
4120;AE179_003;Normal vehicles won't be able to climb a slope as steep as this. It's like a cliff.
1058;AE142_025;What's with the shaking?
1173;AJ016BB;We need a captain!
2075;AE174_008;Nix 2, Master Arm on!
4208;AE112_023;This is Outpost 48, calling for backup. We can't hold him off any longer.
1735;AJ001X;Damn, what now?
6397;AE202_064;Monsters are being dropped by the aliens in the mountain regions. They're trying to hunt down those who fled into the mountains
2891;AT302DC;You're the one destroying the web for me. Thank you.
2656;AI016DD;I'm sorry, I don't think I can make it back!
1545;AE185_018;IT'S SPECIES GAMMA!
852;AM032ZA;You're wrong.
688;AY073DB;It's nothing.
1206;AE135_001;THEY'VE ENTERED THE CITY!
1245;AN019BE;Let me join your team!
1324;AA071BB;What is your purpose?
1585;AM200BD;It's a long story.
840;AY018DA;Should be clear.
1548;AT302BE;Thank you so much, comrade!
1638;AT005BE;DAMN THOSE THREADS!
639;AN020BB;Hi, Captain.
682;AG010AC;INSIDE IT!
1184;AP015DC;Pray eliminated.
1513;AE001BC;WOAH!
1287;AM101BE;IT'S COMMON SENSE!
883;AE121_008;Move in!
1059;AE006_006;THEY'RE ATTACKING!
1222;AR042BB;ALL REVENGE!
1175;AM131BC;Don't say it now!
1609;AE153_004;Let's give our boys a hand!
512;AM047BA;ROGER!
1842;AE198_010;All units, prepare for combat!
937;AC019BC;Can't stop shaking?
1465;AEX04_036;Zero aliens left.
2034;AN001CA;A civilian? We'll protect you!
659;AQ004DC;I'm hit!
3001;AEX04_314;The aliens will be called colonists from now on.
1349;AE125_018;They cut off our retreat route!
1542;AY008DD;I'm so grateful!
350;AM025AB;Got it.
675;AH003Y;I'll cover you!
4706;AA021BD;I applied to join logistic support missions. Maybe this is my last time on the front line.
899;AM077DB;That's what I heard!
1451;AE021BC;This weapon is effective!
2091;AR001W;We need a commander! Hold on!
2027;AE179_021;AH! ALIENS!
1504;AE132_030;You've proven yourself!
2037;AL038BD;I would like to take a rest.
2039;AEX04_091;Air raid complete. Returning to base.
2045;AE104_020;Sergeant, thank you for your support.
2594;AE042BB;Did you see that? I'm unmatched!
1169;AC002CB;Approaching the enemy!
973;AE046BC;Attack your left!
704;AG008AC;GET STARTED!
2383;AE164_028;Mothership has deployed drones! Type 2!
861;AM085Y;Is that so?
928;AF003Y;Didn't they spot us?
1054;AB003DC;AHHHHH!
711;AD003AB;Ready, weapon!
871;AM033Z;Don't be silly!
1862;AO010BA;Oh no, I'm out of ammo!
805;AM001DB;Hang in there!
1025;AE100_017;Not bad!
794;AE009BA;Gotcha!
679;AM041BE;Definitely.
1334;AB013DB;I'm tired to death!
7720;AE210_005;They're wearing the golden armor. I don't think they'll pay us any attention. But we'll let them know that underestimating us is a deadly mistake.
1905;AR004BB;Oh no, we lost our captain!
1663;AE163_010;Team 3, secure the rear.
2243;AM010DD;Such wounds won't stop you from flying!
2467;AT001X;I got caught in the web! Save me!
831;AY056DC;I'm outta here.
468;AM025DA;Okay.
1237;AEX02_012;Someone's wounded!
1001;AM045CA;That's not right!
1646;AC008BA;We're almost in the enemy's range!
1588;AL002DB;YEAH!
1713;AN013DB;Hi Captain, nice to meet you.
727;AE211_004;ARRESTED!
2243;AR004BA;Oh no! We lost our captain!
2860;AE005_037;It's a new enemy! That's a mysterious monster!
940;AE006BE;WATCH THIS!
3739;AE001_027;Keep up, the bottom of the base is huge, it's easy to get lost.
1242;AE008DD;LEAVE THIS ONE TO ME!
2771;AO019BB;The ammo doesn't come out! The gun's jammed!
652;AP005AC;Defeated it!
1225;AC002BC;I'll fight with you, Captain.
1022;AE179_061;Monsters
1141;AT301AC;I'm grateful for your help.
370;AE202_088;What?
1667;AF005Z;Make no sound when moving.
1558;AK020BC;ENEMY RESPONSE IS SPOTTED!
3138;AF032BE;Attack in silence. That's what the best soldiers do.
1600;AA079DD;I don't want to walk here.
2050;AE157_016;Please inform us of the current situation.
1999;AE164_035;That mothership has left this area.
5381;AE145_017;We've got railguns and powered exoskeletons to cover our backs. Those bastards can't lay a finger on us.
2186;AE195_013;A king! We've spotted a king!
1183;AE159_038;Rush towards the peak!
1550;AA018BD;Bullets can never hit me!
2910;AA012ZA;You should rely on your own judgment when in a scrimmage.
1233;AE211_034;I L I E N S
1642;AE156_014;We have confirmed monsters!
776;AG006Y;We've been found!
1852;AE145_073;We're gonna die soon!
2090;AE129_053;Demolition team, commence operation!
1551;AE002_005;This your first time holding a gun?
1150;AC008CB;Unlock weapon system.
584;AM065AB;Thank you!
1192;AH006DD;Are the wings all good?
1324;AY072DD;We'll think of something.
3168;AE119_038;There's no cover on the shore! Fire at will!
1696;AA035AB;Even though it's painful, you fight!
992;AA067BD;Why are you here?
1252;AZ015PA;Gun hatch opened!
1758;AE132_025;We should have brought the main force with us.
1384;AA036Y;Do you have any reasons to fight?
2301;AN021BB;Hey, so nice to see you here.
1626;AM158BE;YOU HAD A DREAM LIKE THAT?!
1181;AN003BC;What are you doing, civilian?
1332;AG004CA;Prepare for battle!
1860;AE185_006;Fall back! Get off the bridge!
1909;AEX04_601;Sniper Team, commencing operation!
1429;AN030DB;You are really famous.
1771;AT309DA;You came! Thank you!
912;AE044BD;Go for the left!
10866;AE210_077;The command ship has overwhelming firepower, and ten mother ships are coming to its aid. We've tried our best.
6807;AE180_010;Shut down anti-collision process. Deactivate all safety protocols. Complete. Initiate launch program.
923;AM065DD;I see.
1120;AL025DD;Landed safely.
1249;AM101DB;Get your facts straight!
1498;AY057DC;When this is over, I'm out.
1257;AK007BB;New enemies approaching!
1279;AE039AA;Be careful on the left!
3751;AA011Y;Joining the EDF has always been my dream. Now my dream comes true.
2470;AQ015BA;UGH! UGH! UGH!
1917;AA082BD;I'm so nervous that I'm sweating.
699;AE138_049;Finally!
4232;AE211_121;Oh, you think so, huh? Well, I can still put up a fight!
2117;AE210_102;Canon destruction confirmed.
4378;AE129_009;Fencers are deployed to the right of the demolition team, and you guys will protect their left.
623;AM015Y;Affirmative.
833;AP018BE;Did you see that?
1248;AE210_122;The shield is gone.
994;AM121DD;I'm bored.
1231;AB009BB;They want us to run!
1804;AL008BE;All are blown away!
1748;AY021BB;HAHAHAHAHAHA
1709;AR022BE;THIS THING KILLED MY BUDDY!
694;AE025AB;BODYSHOT!
778;AE107_023;What do you mean?
3236;AE202_015;We've spotted a new breed of aggressive alien species, Gamma!
3857;AE198_038;The red light is blinking! Does it look good?
1807;AS015BB;Somebody kill this guy!
847;AM021ZA;Wait a second!
664;AE158_018;DIVE!
2570;AR004Z;Get up! Don't you die before me!
1782;AE210_057;Now destroy it! Hurry up!
1557;AE006_011;FLYING SAUCERS AGAIN!
1985;AA117BB;The mission is too hard.
1536;AE017BC;I'll shoot you dead!
1297;AR028BC;Big bro got chewed up!
1503;AM182BD;This is for my family.
3526;AE116_022;YOU JUST LOVE YOUR PETS THAT MUCH, HUH?! AHAHAH!
1143;AJ005DC;Where's the reinforcement?
814;AE177_006;I know.
658;AM208BC;WOAH!
1413;AE015CA;Wingdiver for the win!
2497;AF023BC;When the captain fires, we fire together.
6879;AU172DA;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends We will storm ahead until the end
821;AE183_019;Over there!
2061;AEX04_115;Start opening artillery fire!
1373;AE105_010;They look like flying saucers!
949;AM022BE;Genius!
776;AE014BE;Take this!
1054;AM051Y;Unfortunately, no.
1227;AR042BD;I'LL REVENGE!
1034;AG009DB;The enemy is coming!
1595;AV002ZA;Let's save the trapped ones!
1507;AR020DB;I'll save the fallen one!
849;AB010DB;Let's fly!
1820;AE113_020;Monsters are coming from underground!
1146;AI002DA;The output is dropping!
1892;AO011BD;Not good, I'm out of ammo!
1098;AEX04_171;Defend this road!
1532;AE133_029;THEY'RE GIANT MONSTERS!
910;AM169BE;Thank you, sir!
1654;AI002CB;System condition four.
6544;AU112BA;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong.
2858;AA010AA;EDF is the Guardian of Earth, we can't lose!
1146;AJ011Y;Told him not to do that!
1218;AE002_067;BAAAAAAH!
2438;AA138BE;How can we lose to the wing divers?
3653;AE125_016;Enemy landing ships have entered the area. They plan to drop aliens.
1059;AA034BD;Don't go crazy!
1026;AEX04_180;Guard this position!
2262;AE147_031;Getting away soon after making a mess, huh?
1206;AN034BA;I know who you are!
1512;AE114_047;Fire! Fire!
1686;AA014CA;Don't over rely on your equipment.
531;AQ005BE;GULP
12195;AE001_048;Soldiers and it's our duty to protect civilians. Although I would like to guarantee your safety, I can't make that promise as long as the identity of the enemy is unknown. Use your weapon to protect yourself if you're in danger.
418;AM036DC;Yeah!
1501;AA052BD;Getting used to pulling the trigger?
668;AM032V;Agreed.
2730;AT109BD;Over here! I'm over here!
1746;AE121_029;Attacking the base is not working!
7294;AE171_034;The goal of this operation is to destroy the teleportation anchors along with the monsters. Arkalis can be dealt with later.
3113;AN003X;Oh, it's you. Well, nevermind. Ready?
1664;AE012CB;Use the power to attack!
2070;AA050BC;I'm more courageous than anyone else.
2266;AN004DA;You're a brave civilian, I'll protect you.
1465;AM194BC;Because I like it.
1368;AE119_012;Prepare for battle! Hurry!
1543;AG006X;SHIT! WE'RE SPOTTED!
2190;AS011BA;Let go of me! Let go of me!
5515;AE164_038;The Mothership detests being attacked from below, just as expected. Our chance will come.
3873;AE178_010;We'll destroy the teleportation anchors before they start sending in monsters!
2556;AE112_060;Well done, newbie! Keep up the good work!
893;AS004FD;Stop it!
2354;AE162_018;Teleportation ship successfully destroyed.
854;AR001DB;The captain is!
1445;AJ008DA;We can't keep staying here.
1438;AE180_002;They've called for backup!
2000;AZ006PA;You can launch again if you'd like to.
1925;AF007BB;Enemy in sight. Let's attack.
2834;AEX04_552;Confirm unit battle! We're heading over for backup!
1989;AEX04_610;Sniper Team, Execute Operation!
1371;AL021BD;Yahoo!
781;AM063BB;Can't do.
2781;AE156_018;When you're stuck to the web, destroy it and you'll be free!
4041;AE002_173;After we get out, visit the Army Recruiter. He'll help you with the paperwork.
781;AY053DD;See you!
1699;AE002_031;Let's escape from underground!
1029;AM162DC;I can't believe it!
2233;AL010DD;E-D-F! E-D-F!
4044;AZ008M;Epimetheus to aerators, attack ended. We will start submerging.
1051;AE041AC;Keep the formation!
523;AY024DD;Haha
2026;AE171_037;We must kill Oculus this time!
1191;AM066DD;That's what I was taught.
1070;AA040BD;Are you shaking?
2136;AM196BA;I did it after listening to others' opinions.
3054;AE184_001;This is insane!
1706;AT107BE;Damn! I can't move!
902;AE191_017;ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!
936;AY063DD;Forgive me.
2000;AE071BD;NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ALLOWED!
1921;AE050BD;NOW! ATTACK THE LEGS!
2750;AE150_028;It's route changes all the time. It's hard to predict.
994;AG004Y;The enemy is coming!
6810;AU032Y;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
2357;AK018BA;Today is such a tiring day!
3205;AE159_025;Look at that mountain. It's weird.
3053;AN014DD;What a coincidence! I'm looking for a commander too!
952;AEX04_189;Goin' down!
1093;AL025DA;Landed safely.
796;AM059X;That's weird!
1637;AE132_023;Watch your steps! Don't fall!
1644;AZ035G;Machine guns, fire!
1180;AK004CB;ENEMY DETECTED!
746;AY059BD;Pardon me.
899;AE030AC;SHOOT AT THE LEFT!
3025;AE117_057;There must be a monster nation further ahead!
1159;AA036DB;Will return alive.
6796;AU122AA;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens.
1748;AR022BA;THIS THING KILLED MY BUDDY!
1398;AC002ZA;The reaction is close.
1202;AO029BE;Change the cartridge!
976;AP007DC;Hit confirmed!
4028;AE157_014;I can't see clearly, but there must be lots of aliens ahead!
2594;AN001DD;A civilian? I must protect him!
1269;AL030BE;We're invincible!
529;AM039Y;Agreed.
767;AM078X;Thanks!
852;AM104DC;Guess so.
2918;AL003W;E.D.F.!
498;AM020W;GOT IT!
2131;AEX04_485;Aliens in space suits confirmed!
1894;AQ005EA;GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
894;AA007AA;Clear the mission!
1862;AE121_004;They even built their own houses!
845;AA044BA;Do you need support?
1235;AEX04_009;Enemies straight ahead!
2039;AL013AC;Report that we've eliminated enemies around!
1164;AR010BA;He was a great captain!
1529;AD005BA;Shoot them once they're in range!
1150;AA045DC;Did you call your family?
1013;AP020BD;You deserve it!
1962;AF013DC;Hush, they might find us.
1231;AA084BA;I can't see without light.
2040;AA137BE;Fencers are the strongest soldiers!
633;AZ026G;STRIKE!
4171;AE103_029;We did it! The pylon can be destroyed by attacking the upper part!
2183;AJ001W;Our soldiers are scattered all over the place!
751;AE018DC;LOOK AT ME!
1458;AE009V;Concentrate your fire!
2577;AN003DC;I have no choice. Come with me.
2231;AO005V;Reloading! Back me up for two seconds!
1076;AM140DB;I've made up my mind.
968;AM005BD;I'll back you up!
1287;AA047AA;Are you scared of the dark?
971;AY033BE;I'm disappointed.
1547;AD004ZA;Ready for flying combat!
1472;AA001EA;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHS
1250;AR036BD;Ken got chewed up!
5118;AE125_006;Defeat the artillery unit at all cost! As long as they exist, we can't win the ground warfare!
2631;AI003BC;It's no good if the situation goes on like this.
1419;AE206_003;Do we have what it takes, though?
1791;AR038BE;My- My body is dead!
1775;AE172_009;We've confirmed big anchors!
16674;AE202_025;The monsters are hosting microorganisms in their body fluids. When the monsters die, the fluids start to spread those microorganisms across the land, which in turn have the ability to solidify carbon. In other words, it can absorb carbon dioxide.
3961;AE114_056;This is Delta Team! We are engaging an alien infantry unit!
2280;AC026BC;I'M THE ULTIMATE SOLDIER!
752;AM160BE;You saved me!
1504;AA023BD;I have someone to protect.
1246;AK016BE;The job will never end!
611;AE141_042;We did it!
403;AM021CB;Got it.
492;AE183_003;Roger!
2926;AF001Z;Let's get closer to the enemy and wipe them out in one go.
704;AE043BC;Go for the right!
652;AD003BC;INCOMING!
4556;AE001_056;Hey, civilian. We might be running into some monsters. Take care of yourself, got it?
2786;AE002_054;DIE YOU MONSTER! DIE! DIE!
1182;AM126BD;Don't get it wrong!
1964;AA114BB;Isn't this operation kind of messy?
1510;AZ025H;Mortar! Fire!
1168;AE180_033;There's an army of them!
1016;AE046BD;Attack your left!
1309;AO009W;I'm out of ammo!
2439;AL036DC;They won. I can't believe it.
1325;AL008BD;All are blown away!
926;AE014BA;Take this!
1342;AEX04_515;Teleportation anchors!
2576;AE132_001;I've memorized the route! Follow me!
490;AQ001W;AHHH!
1655;AEX04_591;Rocket launcher team in position!
971;AM029V;Yeah, sure.
4419;AE100_002;A powered exoskeleton hits like a truck. You don't want to get in their way.
1381;AH009DB;We have to protect the injured!
1447;AJ006DD;Report the casualties!
1385;AG004BE;The enemy is closing in!
1790;AC010BB;I will take down the enemies!
6771;AU032V;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
1659;AF033BB;And it also leads to victory.
3306;AE187_002;Secure our homeland for humankind! Defeat the enemies!
1752;AM116BB;Don't say stupid things.
1290;AC002BD;I'll fight with you, Captain.
1403;AK013BC;Did you hear something strange?
2769;AEX04_235;The fog will impair your vision. Proceed cautiously.
1320;AR025BB;Bring me a coffin!
1696;AI018BD;It's hurting, I'm done.
1510;AE121_012;ARTILLERY ATTACKS!
2242;AE104_032;So that's the ship that deploys those pylons.
1563;AB010BE;They want us to move forward!
2528;AA004BE;I'm confident of my shooting. Just count on me.
1448;AM193BD;I've always wanted to do so.
3622;AE143_038;There's loads of monsters coming out from the giant teleportation anchor!
822;AA002FB;No!
2444;AD007X;We can attack after they get in range, right?
7592;AU131DC;Fight deep down into the deepest caves. Fighting off the monsters as they come wave after wave.
2627;AE141_038;There are still some remaining cannons. You'll get shot down.
2479;AE117_052;Monsters keep coming out from inside the cave!
655;AE003_045;DAMN!
1150;AF019DC;They haven't found us yet!
7324;AE211_095;This operation won't be in vain! No... no matter how great the cost... we... we must...
1421;AD003ZA;Master arm on!
7634;AU111BE;Now we will evade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
1483;AA089DA;Birds can't fly at night!
1896;AA127BB;I can't imagine we will lose.
891;AA034Y;Why did you enlist?
607;AM041BA;Definitely!
2339;AEX04_123;Artillery unit will open fire right away.
1930;AI008BC;Bring me the medicinal supply!
1287;AR024BE;Farewell, comrade!
1398;AA007CB;There seems to be no wind.
1642;AE004_061;They're different from the ones before!
1515;AP016DD;Hit! Did you see that?
522;AM047BC;ROGER!
1525;AM147BD;You watch too much TV.
6973;AU022BD;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
2073;AA056BA;I'll treat you to a thickly cut steak.
1025;AL016BA;WE WON!
1277;AEX04_527;What is that device?
637;AM039W;Agreed.
7139;AU012DD;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns!
2992;AL007AC;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1369;AE191_002;Charge enemy lines!
2099;AM146BD;You play too many video games.
1738;AEX04_026;Enemy confirmed from behind!
935;AE177_031;GET PREPARED!
1174;AE011CA;Attack from the air!
1955;AN027BB;So I'll take you as our acting captain.
1997;AT002DD;His wings are unable to stretch!
4262;AE179_041;It's been passed around like a hot potato. They say it's a piece of junk.
788;AY071DB;It happens.
2316;AE147_025;The new-type drones are coming at us!
1175;AM100DB;You watch out!
2396;AI003BB;That's no good if the situation goes on like this!
429;AE002CA;YA
1061;AE026V;SHOOT!
639;AM170BE;Thank you!
744;AT101DC;AHHH!
696;AM142DD;That's feet.
386;AM043BD;Got it!
1267;AD009BD;THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!
849;AY003BD;Let me thank you.
1618;AE120_019;You've completed your mission, newbie.
1071;AEX04_187;Entering the cave!
1198;AT003AC;YOU WANNA PULL ME OVER?!
784;AM021DC;You did it!
2017;AEX04_663;Spriggan unit engage the enemy
976;AE019W;More to the right!
3034;AE158_041;Each attack is death-defying. That is too risky.
712;AH001V;Evade!
1174;AM068BB;Let's talk about it later.
988;AM100DC;You watch out!
2612;AY041DA;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
2136;AT304BD;Who destroyed the net? I must thank him!
3179;AE110_019;We must stop the monsters here! Don't let them enter the city!
1624;AE109_013;This monster is red!
2759;AE104_036;Crap. Who the hell is behind all this?
1739;AD006BC;Attack them once they're in range!
1233;AE112_009;How are the new types doing?
878;AY047BC;I'll fight with you.
587;AEX04_134;Aim!
2708;AE003_015;Did they start shooting a movie in the base while we were gone?
595;AE016DA;Faster!
387;AQ003ZA;Gah!
502;AM016CA;Okay.
2655;AE109_018;These things don't spit acid, so don't give up!
1397;AEX04_139;Run cooling system.
1321;AE163_006;MOVE! MOVE!
1015;AM031DB;Sir, yes sir!
591;AE022AB;HEADSHOT!
3036;AE002_003;Civilian, keep up! Stay close if you want to live.
1050;AT204DC;Someone got stuck!
2233;AE211_137;We'll be fine. Just go!
1127;AI012BC;SO UNLUCKY
624;AM130DB;I love you.
1708;AA077BD;Where does this cave lead to?
2229;AT203AA;Look at that web! People got caught!
1377;AE141_021;TOO MANY CANNONS!
359;AQ005BA;Gah!
777;AE107_031;Monsters
2417;AA096BD;I want to breathe the air outside.
708;AM078Y;It just happened.
2929;AR012BA;Our captain died! We need a replacement, Commander!
4801;AEX04_720;The transport aircraft will arrive shortly. It will drop the Baga on the battlefield.
1076;AE199_007;And they're fast!
1488;AD007BB;CONFIRM THE SHOOTING RANGE!
1792;AE125_003;Take out the enemy artillery unit.
1979;AE015AC;Relax! I'll bring you back safe!
1263;AM184BC;This is for my lover.
321;AM025AC;Got it.
944;AM023BE;MASTER!
3436;AA120BE;Being a soldier isn't a special job anymore nowadays.
3364;AA091DD;I'm surprised the military would manufacture aerial units.
7595;AU141AA;Farewell, my comrades, the time has come. It's over now, my love, and my familiarly are all gone.
1808;AE051BE;Now! Attack the arms!
651;AE138_056;FIRE!
6436;AE145_039;I've seen aliens deploying giant walkers to destroy Earth on animes, but I never thought I would see this in real life.
2431;AA020DA;No one can stand up to an attack from the sky.
2236;AA098BB;Let me breathe the air outside.
6064;AE152_007;More than destroying the spacesuits! Focus your attacks on the same place! Kill the aliens inside!
3262;AE211_046;It's over! We can't defeat this monster!
588;AM018X;ROGER!
3289;AA030V;I have no family, my comrades are my everything!
3715;AE154_003;We found traces of the Mother Monster. We're in for a tough battle.
1885;AA014ZA;Don't over-rely on your equipment!
906;AH004CA;Cover the injured!
652;AE160_002;Let's move.
2761;AA088BE;I didn't expect to really go on an underground adventure.
1076;AA007BE;I never lose.
633;AF014DA;Shut up!
1467;AJ012BA;Where's the new commander?!
1359;AZ052G;Job done. Great.
1174;AE028AA;Who's gonna kill it?
567;AY022BB;Hahahaha
777;AA014V;Don't let up!
697;AF016AB;Don't wake them up.
1820;AA114BC;Isn't this operation kinda messy?
840;AG003DB;Attack!
2904;AY012DD;Nothing to thank you for. I was fine by myself.
1056;AA035DB;Let's do this together.
1281;AE167_008;Another one coming down!
1092;AA079BE;Don't get left behind.
1927;AT006DB;Get me out of the web!
919;AY071DA;It happens.
3730;AZ058G;First time seeing this type of attack request code. Who could that be?
846;AM117BD;You mistook it.
1415;AA011BD;Let's get serious today.
2051;AK003BC;The scout reports that the enemy is sighted!
1035;AM076BD;What if I could?!
885;AE018DA;Look at me!
1148;AE015DD;You can't hit me!
1614;AE002_015;Eat that, monster!
1474;AE004_016;THEY'RE FLYING IN THE AIR!
2359;AN021AB;I've heard about you. Let's fight together.
1206;AE002_024;There are just too many!
683;AH001BE;WATCH OUT!
3250;AE147_008;We're not the best against the drones. Request for support.
1305;AL014DC;Exterminated!
1030;AM018BC;I'm impressed!
3062;AT004BC;I'm stuck in the web! Save me!
967;AM069BD;IMPOSSIBLE
3010;AD009AB;Not close enough. Let's wait for the enemy to get in range first.
1951;AC016AA;We're in the combat zone, watch out!
3941;AE129_051;Leave the last blow to us. We will blow it into pieces!
1426;AE211_071;Doesn't it get tired?
777;AM089Y;AHHH!
2278;AE114_042;Aliens are descending from the flying ship!
2651;AE207_022;The mothership wants us dead at all costs!
1244;AY064BE;I didn't mean to.
912;AM019DA;Amazing!
1060;AE041AA;Keep the formation!
933;AN012AA;I will fight with you!
2768;AE125_013;Artillery unit incoming. Approach and attack.
818;AY031BB;That's a shame.
1346;AEX04_043;Five enemies left!
2165;AC005DC;Enemies detected. Really close.
906;AM023BC;Master!
1060;AE013BC;WATCH THIS!
6854;AU112CA;Deep into the darkness, marching on, we fear no danger, we stay strong.
1792;AA008AA;Kick out those illegal intruders!
1757;AE044AC;Humankind will fight to the end!
1096;AE020BB;FIRE YOUR WEAPON!
929;AQ009BA;I'VE BEEN HIT!
6894;AU172AA;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end.
2018;AE105_053;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1028;AO002AC;Reloading ammo
802;AZ016PB;Shooting mode.
6727;AU152V;Why should I still keep on fighting, on shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
11631;AE197_027;This report dates back to 17 years ago. The wreckage of a spaceship was discovered in the mountains of India. By estimation, it crashed down to Earth some thousands of years ago.
1069;AP026BD;That's one!
3121;AE202_037;This is number 15, Sentinel-2. Please respond.
1615;AJ007BB;AREN'T THE RESCUE TEAMS HERE YET?!
3576;AE158_004;Launch an airstrike to distract the enemy. Wait here for further instruction.
2394;AN005X;Storm One, good luck.
7586;AU031DA;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1518;AA047DA;There is someone I'm interested in.
1452;AE117_002;MONSTERS!
1241;AB011BD;We're running again?
1846;AA096DA;I have over 20 flying hours.
994;AY034DD;Sigh...
1707;AP016DC;Hit! Did you see that?
2411;AI006W;I'm hurt! I need rescue!
1785;AE049BD;NOW! ATTACK THE HEAD!
1150;AE159_062;Multiple queens!
1738;AA023V;Remember a soldier's honor!
975;AA042DC;Didn't you sleep well?
1155;AM054BB;I'll take care of this!
1832;AI006CB;Ugh, my wounds!
1689;AI008BA;Bring me the medicinal supply!
2455;AT006BA;I'm stuck in the web! Help me!
2526;AY041DC;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
7851;AU151BD;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
5347;AE118_043;How could this creature sustain direct attacks from cannons? Is it invincible?
1416;AC021DB;I'll show you my moves!
2219;AL036DB;We won! I can't believe it!
2068;AE192_006;That's why they can multiply so easily!
1845;AF012AA;Don't waste your shots, they will find us.
3567;AE002_108;It's no joke if you get spit on! We must kill them before they get us!
4671;AZ001G;This is fighter bomber DE-202, about to enter the air combat area again.
2198;AEX04_331;CONFIRMED! MUTATED FLYING AGGRESSOR!
1532;AE155_021;The threads are coming at us!
1381;AE133_026;A huge chamber!
3368;AE001_055;I'll take the lead. You guys watch my back and stay close.
2762;AE140_030;We're prepared to die! Just use us as your cover!
2113;AE179_036;We're approaching the hangar! Let's go!
889;AO004CA;Power Control!
4091;AE174_038;So many people were, it was all DeRoy's fault.
918;AP014BA;One killed!
1221;AH019BA;WE'RE BEING ATTACKED!
1934;AE118_025;This is Bull Leader. Enemy confirmed.
1154;AP025BA;TO KEROWAN!
3168;AA139BD;It's my first time to use the military-powered exoskeleton!
1217;AE025V;FIRE!
866;AL020AB;Let's chill out a bit.
975;AP005Z;Go to hell!
4486;AE130_036;We are in a critical situation. Our troops are faced with being completely wiped out.
1184;AI011BD;WE NEED RESCUE!
1843;AM071W;Anything you want, my treat.
1268;AM051AA;THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
2740;AEX04_110;Artillery fire requested. Opening fire now.
2670;AEX02_031;I think they are called colonists.
1120;AT004CA;Take down that creature!
1433;AEX04_148;Requesting missile attack.
1342;AA078DA;I don't hate caves.
3076;AA014X;I dreamed that I got promoted. What a nightmare.
1149;AE136_019;All units retreat.
738;AB003V;Let's go!
1121;AZ011PB;Target confirmed.
1260;AR034BB;Kay got chewed up!
2349;AA078BD;I can't stand it anymore. I want to go home.
1335;AA059DC;Why did you join the EDF?
3051;AZ047G;Designated area hit. Looks like we did our part.
5494;AA133BB;With a powered exoskeleton, even weak men can be strong. But you must train yourself.
1926;AE181_023;We can just enjoy the show.
1076;AM129BE;Confirm once again!
891;AM155BB;Either way!
1660;AA062BD;Wanna play a word chain game?
701;AE141_057;Take that!
572;AZ021I;Fire!
7586;AE147_028;If they start dropping these drones in other parts of the world, that would be a great disaster for humankind. We must do something!
1350;AM198BA;I didn't really think it through.
1686;AM032DB;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
3797;AE141_078;The alien infantry will be called colonists from now on.
664;AM083BC;I agree.
634;AY058BE;I'm sorry.
808;AL016DD;We did it!
849;AN007CA;We will move with you!
1599;AD023DB;Stabilizer, max out!
789;AM050BE;SOUNDS GOOD!
847;AE100_029;Nice.
2014;AH007AA;Be careful! We're in enemy's range!
1264;AR019DB;Did someone get chewed up?!
4464;AEX04_258;I don't like to attack at night. I almost died in the dark so many times.
1432;AE174_030;DeRoy's taken down!
726;AM058AC;Check it again!
3747;AE210_113;For them, you are the real Grim Reaper.
1286;AA001BE;Show them our strength!
1209;AE145_023;ADVANCE!
2023;AA089BC;It's my first time in a cave like this.
18047;AE209_004;The aliens are trying to wipe out all trace of our existence here on Earth. They don't negotiate, and they don't accept our surrender. They will keep attacking until the last man on Earth is dead. There is no way out. Our only option is to fight back, and show them what we are made of!
1237;AL020CB;Look after the patients!
1700;AE146_033;We're gonna hide here for how long?
2409;AJ015BB;Someone give us instructions!
1659;AE171_036;Now, fire at Arcellus!
493;AM051DA;NO!
1213;AC002AA;The battle will begin soon.
361;AY025BB;Heh.
502;AJ003BE;Crap!
726;AM116DC;I got that.
2310;AL009CA;YEAH!
1412;AM152DB;That's the kind of woman I am.
850;AM064AC;I'll pay you back.
1515;AE210_012;DESTROY THE TELEPORTATION SHIP!
464;AA038BB;Cover me!
1766;AT302BB;Thank you so much, comrade!
2706;AA048AA;Don't just use your eyes, feel the enemies.
2164;AE036BA;I'll make some juicy steak of you!
1762;AE005_044;It's the mysterious monster!
1690;AC012DA;Weapon system activate!
4501;AE210_068;We're under heavy fire! I repeat, we're under heavy fire!
2146;AF002BD;Looks like the enemy can't find our location.
1558;AF002AA;Be quiet or we'll be found.
1028;AM094DC;Wrong from the start!
1725;AE129_064;Get away from the base! Hurry!
718;AM069AA;Whaaat?
3490;AE138_011;Titans are mobile fortresses that can defend us from the strongest enemies!
3625;AE210_090;Hang in there! Uh! UUUUUUUUUGH!
1576;AE003_008;This is Iota 2, roger that!
628;AM016Z;YES!
1038;AC023BA;Are we gonna fight?
769;AD003BE;INCOMING!
2765;AE130_008;Damn! So this is the true form of the bass!
368;AM038BE;Okay.
1509;AB004BA;FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN!
831;AB005BC;I'll follow you!
3805;AEX04_243;The sandstorm will impair your vision! Proceed cautiously!
1511;AM185BD;This is for revenge.
1006;AE177_026;KEEP MOVING!
1242;AE186_005;Destroy the flying type!
1145;AEX04_717;Dispatching barda
797;AY072BD;We'll figure it out.
1574;AE003_012;I can't believe that!
994;AA067DB;What's your purpose?
1099;AD004AA;Ready your weapon!
2589;AE110_022;Our targets are huge. You can't miss.
6869;AE148_017;The enemy's strength was greatly reduced after we destroyed the leg cannons. Focus fire on their legs!
773;AM053Y;You've got it wrong.
531;AQ002CB;AH!
2429;AE211_009;What the hell? What is that guy doing?
2006;AE175_002;There are also lots of flying types!
1317;AB010BA;They want us to move forward!
1448;AA081BA;The enemy is hiding in the dark.
3123;AZ010O;Satellite W-1 was hacked? By whom?
1130;AE141_052;The base is moving!
359;AY051BC;Later.
495;AE149_032;Great!
2105;AE001_039;I've never seen creatures like these before.
2914;AEX04_538;IT'S THE MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ARCULUS!
1964;AO020BC;WHY CAN'T I FIRE THE BULLETS?!
1024;AY076DB;We're partners, right?
1015;AY040BD;At your service.
1739;AE117_054;Monsters are coming out from the cave!
3112;AE145_049;Check the inside! I've never seen this type of alien!
1004;AE028X;HAVING FUN?
1307;AL018CB;What a weak opponent!
1588;AM101BB;IT'S COMMON SENSE!
677;AM041AB;NEXT TIME!
1483;AE011CB;Attack from the air!
1181;AE158_030;THERE ARE ALIENS!
1908;AN008BC;You're lucky. I'll help you.
1349;AEX04_033;Three aliens left.
1197;AE151_003;WE'RE SURROUNDED!
1514;AA042BB;Is there someone waiting for you at home?
682;AM001Y;You all right?
2966;AF007DC;Approaching target. Don't get dragged into a tangled battle.
290;AY025DD;Heh
1532;AF004DB;Now's the best time to assault!
617;AJ011DC;Anyone?
1533;AL024BD;Victory is ours!
625;AO001DC;Charge!
2912;AR012BD;Our captain died! We need a replacement commander!
644;AZ019Q;Drop off!
736;AM072DA;That's right!
1278;AH027BA;I'LL PROTECT YOU CAPTAIN!
2644;AE143_017;The teleportation anchors are dropping from the sky!
2697;AY011BC;EDF doesn't leave men behind, ever.
733;AY070BA;Fine by me.
1775;AA077DD;You can't fly too high here!
1850;AD013DA;Still outside the effective range!
2215;AC009DC;System normal, ready to engage.
521;AH001AB;Evade!
1277;AM103BD;That's written in the books!
1846;AE144_013;They're shooting darts! Take cover!
680;AY039BC;All yours!
2195;AA070DC;I can still fly even if we're underground.
7621;AU151W;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
760;AM207BA;Oh my.
6802;AU142BC;Still I will fight the Endless Scream There's no one home to wait for me
753;AE006Z;NOW!
3738;AA105BB;I had done the training for a guard, but not for a soldier.
584;AY043BB;Good morning.
1090;AE015DB;You can't hit me!
1960;AD010AA;They're out of range! Let's get closer!
1018;AD003CB;Prepare to shoot!
1150;AF018DC;Why don't we just shoot them dead?
3736;AQ008AB;GAAAAAAH!
1439;AD010BE;Let's do it! Don't miss!
807;AM049AB;Great idea!
1059;AE105_065;Engage the enemy!
1217;AM197BE;It just somehow happened.
6781;AE108_014;The enemy's plan is to fill the city with monsters, but we won't let that happen. Destroy the pylons and stop the enemy's plan!
2591;AE131_011;There are monsters ahead!
858;AEX04_011;To the rear!
1579;AE156_002;Attack Aranea's!
1201;AE164_034;Mothership is leaving!
1588;AE190_008;Charge enemy lines!
872;AA075BE;Is something over there?
1335;AE014DB;We can win this battle!
1180;AG003BE;THE ENEMY'S MOVING!
876;AE005AC;SHOOT THEM DEAD!
1143;AE103_003;Look at the sky!
8323;AE104_022;Sergeant, the enemy is much stronger than you can imagine. The whole world is being attacked right now. We already have our hands full with managing the situation.
2823;AEX03_009;HELP HIM OUT! ATTACK THE URINAE OUT!
1403;AE137_001;We've managed to approach the enemy!
1595;AL048BE;I'll receive more medals.
1399;AZ012I;Smoke grenades confirmed!
4204;AE198_051;Flying-type monsters are natural enemies of the Barga. Infantry, take them out!
2115;AN001BC;Are you a civilian? I'll protect you.
1029;AE113_012;Exterminate them!
1296;AE177_023;That was close.
1795;AE123_003;They're trying to drop aliens!
436;AB001DC;GO!
1082;AA079BD;Don't get left behind.
1894;AE205_023;The monsters are coming from above!
1085;AH008BA;You can't die!
2134;AE186_033;Queens are approaching our troops from behind!
1579;AA010CB;Stay on cruise mode.
7649;AU021AA;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
2040;AE172_005;Let's take down the aliens' outpost!
665;AS002AA;Let go!
1390;AEX04_384;MONSTER INCOMING!
2253;AE004_078;These soldiers are big, but agile!
1442;AC018BB;I'm counting on you, partner!
3464;AM141DC;There's no other choices than fighting. Am I wrong?
438;AM033BA;Roger!
2088;AF017DD;We could be spotted once we attack!
1419;AC025DB;Huh! Take this!
1705;AA015X;It's wonderful being a soldier.
2026;AE195_010;Monsters a lot of them
1313;AE146_010;RUN! THIS WAY!
1669;AS008BA;Help me!
2024;AI005V;You were strong, even without me.
971;AQ003DA;AHHH!
738;AL037BE;That's enough.
1988;AEX02_027;I'm glad our suits are acid resistant!
1320;AE180_011;Balga standing by.
2877;AA116BA;I finally understand. It's no use to run away.
2332;AE141_019;Hang in there! Fight back with all we've got!
529;AP012DA;Great!
2809;AE211_051;What if... it's not a weapon?
882;AA006AA;Do as planned.
1860;AA069AC;Believe in powered exoskeletons!
1862;AZ037H;I didn't hit our allies, did I?
3952;AA043W;Everyone has their weakness, such as fearing dark and narrow places.
1434;AA037BD;Be serious sometimes!
2623;AL010DC;E-D-F! E-D-F!
1120;AEX04_256;What a quiet night.
1050;AE143_019;It's coming this way!
2320;AA106BD;I was still a security guard until last week!
2192;AE198_045;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1791;AT107BD;Damn! I can't move!
1071;AH010AB;We'll get you a medic!
704;AC019AA;Plan B!
2557;AEX04_076;Air raid completed. Continue operation.
4530;AE002_036;There's a passage for AFVs. Let's go through that passage to the surface.
2377;AE170_005;Don't retreat! Meet up with a sergeant instead!
1768;AR007DC;I can't believe you are gone!
1477;AL048BA;I'll receive more medals.
945;AM073DA;Totally agree!
2120;AE176_027;Approach the enemy to protect the infantry!
1220;AK009BA;I heard there is the enemy!
987;AY071BD;It happens.
1463;AF003BB;I think we can approach them now.
1404;AI001BB;Crap! My armor is...
917;AE211_084;Understood!
1736;AE029W;Attacking the enemy now!
2059;AE131_017;It's aliens! Why are they here?
1906;AE003_042;Sergeant, glad to know you are fine.
782;AY042BE;Nice meeting you.
843;AE027BE;BRING IT!
1658;AM192BA;I simply wanted to do so.
1039;AK002AC;The enemy is here!
1240;AM122DB;Stop daydreaming!
538;AQ001CA;What?!
1240;AE168_041;Ready for bombing!
2182;AEX04_354;Teleportation anchor is dropping down!
1703;AR006X;Hold on! Wait for the medic!
1243;AM143DA;Because I love the sky.
1322;AEX04_701;Dispatching heavy tanks!
990;AD001CA;Prepare to fly!
1064;AE017X;Eat the bullet!
1159;AE024BA;TAKE MY BULLET!
740;AE022AC;HEADSHOT!
1274;AC006DB;Sensor is responding.
5210;AE152_006;Destroying the spacesuits is not good enough for defeating the enemies. We must attack the aliens inside!
2160;AA091BD;Feels like a ghost might come out.
1803;AT304AA;I'm finally out! Thank you!
1933;AI014DD;At this rate, I'm going to fall!
1478;AN010DC;I'll be in charge of protecting you.
1059;AN015BB;All yours, Captain.
1881;AM075W;I'll treat you to a nice restaurant!
969;AY075BB;I'm having fun!
2239;AA036CA;Become a Nighthawk, hovering in dark nights!
1423;AR032BC;George got chewed up!
1571;AEX04_319;CONFIRMED SPECIES BETA!
2613;AE211_070;The giant is becoming more and more powerful.
2323;AE145_057;They're elite units that have received combat training!
2478;AD004DB;We'll launch the attack once they get into range!
806;AY031DC;What a shame.
372;AM012Y;Got it.
3420;AE152_011;The hero always makes a dramatic entrance. Am I right?
804;AE100_020;Not bad.
1645;AA077DC;You can't fly too high here.
1322;AG017BC;Fire! Fire!
1576;AR010DB;Huh? Captain!
816;AM036AC;Let me think about it.
1012;AY016BE;Mission complete!
1103;AM115DD;I suppose!
1173;AM150BA;Alright, I got it!
1805;AI004BD;I can still fight! UGH!
2012;AEX04_326;CONFIRMED! SILVER SPECIES BETA!
4301;AE211_066;So many have sacrificed, but what for?
1797;AM032DD;I swear in Wingdiver's name!
3589;AE173_007;Unfortunately, only a few survivors went southward to take refuge.
2610;AE163_050;IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING IS FLYING TOWARDS THIS WAY!
1302;AEX04_045;Three enemies left!
762;AM074Y;Thank you, sir!
2172;AE022BD;You shall not pass!
4578;AE211_109;What, in God's name? We have a survivor!
2785;AZ041Q;In case of emergency, civilians are allowed to board.
1403;AM008DA;Get up and keep fighting!
1378;AA043DA;Didn't you sleep well last night?
2087;AE116_027;There are more that we can manage by ourselves!
630;AM131DC;Thank you.
2569;AD006AA;Take aim! Fire when they get in range!
1470;AE050BC;NOW ATTACK THE LEGS!
1389;AT003X;I GOT STUCK IN THE WEB!
782;AP006DA;Direct hit!
2293;AE114_090;There are way too many enemies. Retreat!
1781;AO020BD;WHY CAN'T I FIRE THE BULLETS?!
1218;AN019BD;Let me join your team!
612;AE114_084;Good job.
1219;AC001CA;The enemy is close!
1276;AM114BA;That's absolutely wrong.
1191;AT009BE;I CAN'T GET AWAY!
1315;AJ018BC;Over here! I'm over here!
1347;AE136_008;Launch Airstrikes!
1550;AE117_053;There's an army of monsters!
2283;AA028BB;I want to eat barbecued meat now!
465;AM018Z;Stop it!
1518;AE147_010;The battle will soon be over!
2399;AD006AC;Take aim! Fire when they get in range!
1174;AC003BB;I'll show you what I have.
521;AEX04_559;Attack!
1396;AE023BD;EAT THE BULLET!
1324;AD021BA;I will show it to you!
924;AC001BC;Ready for battle!
770;AM064BA;Not possible.
1217;AB011BA;WE'RE RUNNING AGAIN?!
6614;AU162BA;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
3924;AA126BB;We have weapons as good as tanks. Show them what we have.
3889;AE117_039;The follow-on forces are headed to your location. Move out after rendezvous.
1475;AD009Z;STRIKE ON MY MOCK!
2105;AA102DD;We should never lose to fencers.
2025;AE211_143;Let's put this tragedy to an end!
481;AM027AA;Fine!
1160;AC013BC;The fight is starting.
3743;AA118BB;I became a soldier only for the pension. I regret it now.
1179;AM006BB;I'll figure out something.
1671;AA066DA;What are the reasons exactly?
874;AY075BD;I'm having fun.
2345;AN017BA;Commander is required for the mission. Thank you
3733;AT307BB;EDF doesn't leave men behind, but I still want to thank you.
646;AM142DA;That's fate.
474;AM044BE;GOT IT!
1266;AN007DB;I'll follow your command.
1855;AE104_010;Damn! There's no time for rest!
7132;AE167_006;That is a big anchor. It can summon various types of monsters, which makes it extremely dangerous. Destroy it immediately!
934;AO007CA;Power reload!
596;AM050BA;Sounds good!
1746;AR008W;STAY STILL UNTIL THE MEDIC COMES!
598;AM058Y;You said it.
1024;AO005Y;Swap the magazine!
848;AT202CB;Some got caught.
2174;AE110_025;What is the secret behind that golden armor?
1230;AD014BC;Still out of range!
1150;AM069DC;You don't have to tell me.
2031;AA054DD;Beauty is a sin, indeed.
956;AL011Y;I survived!
1160;AB006AA;Go! Go!
1833;AA022W;My life plan is ruined now.
1795;AR006BE;Captain! Please reply!
1321;AEX04_350;Tadpole incoming!
1793;AEX04_441;Flying type CONFIRMED!
3235;AE211_135;You will finish the job while we act as bait.
17771;AE108_016;Now there are numerous people crowding at the EDF headquarters, and it's chaotic on the scene. Not only the press, but many citizens have gathered here. There are people questioning the announcement, asking about EDF's plans, or seeking protection. We can hear requests turning into yelling everywhere.
850;AY066DB;My bad.
2073;AR043BA;Comrade! Leave the rest to me!
1390;AR020BE;An ally is down!
1070;AY060BD;I apologize.
559;AM015W;Roger!
3078;AA045V;Be careful not to accidentally shoot one of us in the dark!
2077;AE038BC;IT'S SHOWTIME!
2325;AE170_027;I was gonna give up. Thank you.
1205;AE194_010;THEY'RE HEAVENLY ARMED!
1189;AA025DA;Aerial unit checked.
1279;AZ018Q;We're on our way, civilian.
916;AL030DA;My work is done.
2891;AE179_023;This is not the monster's breeding ground, is it?
2584;AE130_039;Take down the enemies, rather than the base.
1915;AZ044G;Attack target hit confirmed.
3065;AA097DC;I think I'll stick with flying after leaving the military services.
532;AM008Y;Nice!
3779;AE109_017;They're tough, but there's no acid. We can win.
725;AJ011DD;Anyone?
967;AG006AC;BATTLE BEGINS!
1721;AE173_016;Did they eat all the residents?
2343;AE171_016;GX4, we have confirmed enemies!
1118;AM097BB;That is correct!
1044;AM061Y;Trying to make me laugh?
1063;AT009BA;I CAN'T GET AWAY!
623;AM041BC;Definitely.
2320;AY048BC;From now on, we are part of your unit.
1807;AE197_008;We've arrived at the estimated drop zone.
1375;AY020BC;Hahahaha
681;AM012DD;Awesome!
2177;AZ055G;It was a civilian calling for airstrikes?
1723;AE128_026;INCOMING LANDING SHIPS!
1440;AA019Y;Who would have known this would happen?
2433;AE210_021;Last teleportation ship has been destroyed!
3015;AE141_081;The enemy has sent out their main forces already.
2113;AL008CB;AAAH!!!!
1658;AA053BC;Have you ever wondered why this would happen?
1336;AG006DB;The enemy is attacking!
1697;AY048BA;From now on, we're part of your unit.
1534;AR006DB;REVENGE FOR THE CAPTAIN!
906;AP026BA;That's one!
881;AM014V;AMAZING!
1626;AF002Y;They're not good at searching for humans.
838;AP018BC;Did you see that?
6902;AU022X;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
2367;AE201_013;Look at the sky! It's winged aliens!
2887;AE112_004;Hey newbie, does the army ration suit your palate?
1317;AI005BC;The injury is nothing.
2722;AEX04_580;Ranger unit is going to back you up. Hold your ground.
1394;AE002_137;AHHHHHHHHHHH
1784;AO025BE;Reload! I'm so good at this!
2350;AE114_083;All aliens on the ground have been exterminated!
1892;AR004AC;Damn it! You killed my guys!
1178;AM011BC;Don't let it get to you!
1000;AM214BB;I can't believe it!
1004;AM137BB;No one's complaining.
1914;AF014CA;Don't shoot until the order's given.
2944;AT105BD;I can't move! Somebody help me!
2732;AE168_032;Fighting in this fog is giving us a huge disadvantage!
1302;AH021BE;WE HAVE AN INJURED HERE!
1192;AEX04_365;CONFIRMED, QUEEN!
1083;AG003BB;The enemy is moving!
980;AM006V;I'll protect you!
1086;AM174BD;Let me thank you!
2230;AE114_043;So that is the enemy's landing ship.
2146;AL010BA;E.D.F.! E.D.F.!
3457;AE203_020;Has been eliminated. Thank you!
832;AE164_018;KEEP ON FIGHTING!
1457;AE016V;LET'S TAKE THEM DOWN!
2482;AE210_025;The giant cannon has been activated!
716;AM011CB;Remarkable!
3174;AY011DD;EDF doesn't leave its men behind. It's for real.
1914;AE193_011;Teleportation device confirmed!
1120;AM130BE;Just you wait!
1271;AY036BD;I can't believe it.
1869;AJ007BD;AREN'T THE RESCUE TEAMS HERE YET?!
2098;AT102AA;I can't move! Save me!
1293;AA022CA;Did you enjoy flying?
3084;AO011X;Well, my magazine is gone! Ah, found it.
482;AM033DA;Okay!
1071;AE158_006;Break in, now!
1595;AA043DD;Didn't you sleep well last night?
2089;AC013DB;Plasma Drive, output increases.
1046;AI011DC;It hurts!
464;AQ004BC;Blah!
2176;AE184_017;Teleportation anchor has been neutralized.
1836;AN004CA;Wingdivers will follow your command.
692;AM053BA;Leave it to me!
878;AM010AC;Good job!
954;AA019AC;Did you check the guns?
1065;AL022BA;Hooray!
1538;AA052AA;Calm down. No danger.
7656;AU121AC;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
1715;AEX04_358;Enemy landing ship incoming.
415;AM026CA;NO
2062;AE013AC;Remember your training! Be brave!
1872;AA075DA;So this is the underground wind.
1217;AM111DA;Can we change subjects?
1434;AK004DA;Enemy reaction detected!
1294;AM110BE;That couldn't be true!
603;AM099BC;Agreed!
2099;AI017BD;No, I can't fight anymore!
719;AE177_043;GET READY!
3688;AE001_017;He was eaten! George was EATEN!
791;AG009AC;We've been found!
1220;AE103_018;WHAT IS GOING ON?!
924;AM118DC;Let's do it!
1965;AO009X;BULLETS! WHERE ARE MY BULLETS?!
1889;AE121_030;Our attack on the base was ineffective!
599;AM081AB;What the f-
4211;AE146_049;I can't believe someone really came. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
4429;AE149_024;This is no time for experimenting. Never mind. Just look for ways to avoid missiles.
719;AM013Z;Approved.
1171;AM023DA;I'll reward you later!
1044;AM131BB;Don't say it now!
1247;AA003V;CHECK YOUR SURROUNDINGS!
1643;AE188_003;Destroy them all!
998;AA042W;What's the purpose?
1027;AM122BE;That's not true!
628;AM163BD;Thanks!
1369;AT006AC;GET THOSE THREADS OFF ME!
724;AE005_033;It worked!
4198;AE193_008;As long as that device is intact, more monsters will keep coming. Deal with it!
2263;AC021BA;Stay calm. I have to stay calm.
1343;AE207_005;Monsters as well!
566;AN012CB;YOU?!
1880;AE129_061;Demolition team, retreat!
1593;AE111_014;Large flying saucers!
1224;AE002_056;I can't take it anymore!
1802;AE021DA;The sky belongs to me!
640;AE157_019;What's that?
809;AE018BE;I'll back you up!
6640;AU032X;We shall split our wings wide and fly high, Soaring, gliding to the endless sky.
566;AQ001ED;Gah!
6736;AU172BA;Stand shoulder to shoulder, now brave friends, we will storm ahead until the end!
1148;AR020DC;I'll save the fallen one!
2295;AA048AC;Don't just use your eyes, feel the enemies!
1609;AD005BE;Shoot them once they're in range!
1360;AG003AB;OPEN FIRE!
4792;AE211_031;We have to find a solution! This... and this is our final opportunity!
2207;AA068DD;Why did you quit being a civilian pilot?
857;AE127_005;SHOOT THEM!
4626;AE119_043;Keep on firing, and it'll eventually get hit. Fire at will!
1367;AB007W;Let's go! Run!
1601;AE128_042;We can't hold them back anymore!
3646;AE146_005;Those guys haven't noticed us. We might just kill them out of surprise.
1695;AJ006W;Where's the sergeant?
2717;AN017BB;A commander is required for the mission. Thank you.
2553;AA012BD;Actual fighting is much more fun than training.
1555;AN018BD;Please let me join your team!
1253;AE002_032;Head to the elevator!
2415;AE116_024;They look like us! I can't do it!
1128;AK009BE;I heard there is the enemy!
1361;AE177_021;Grim Reapers, catch up!
1795;AE004_073;They don't look like humans at all!
1069;AEX04_186;Head down this way!
2464;AE125_010;THEY HAVE SOME BADASS WEAPONS!
3152;AE117_005;This is Ranger 2, being attacked by monsters now!
2765;AZ005H;Hey, civilian! Tell me where the enemy is!
858;AY014DA;I recovered!
1937;AK018BB;Today is such a tiring day.
1306;AO012DB;Cool Down starts now!
854;AE142_019;Good timing!
1364;AEX04_696;AFV, engage.
1631;AA026DB;Stabilizer, all normal.
3036;AE121_048;Incoming fire get to cover before it's too late
1598;AG002AA;Now, kill them all!
1122;AA004CB;Wingdivers!
1111;AB002W;Follow the sergeant!
1271;AM004AB;Stay there! I'm coming!
563;AP001BD;We hit it!
747;AM049BA;Sir, yes, sir!
1001;AM003DB;I'll go save you!
1847;AE141_066;Strike the same place repeatedly.
4178;AE190_012;I'm the only one who could use the blazer. I'm needed on the front line.
1509;AE021BB;THIS WEAPON IS EFFECTIVE!
953;AEX04_126;Open fire!
1310;AM183BC;This is for my wife.
2023;AE171_003;Cover the assault team from the sides!
491;AM038AA;NO!
1425;AE002_004;Watch your surroundings!
2656;AE177_007;Don't worry, leave the heavy lifting to us.
1014;AA001V;Keep an eye out!
2504;AE178_012;The teleportation anchors are activated!
585;AM013W;Yes sir.
1386;AM083DD;You're completely wrong!
753;AM058DA;That makes sense.
956;AA040BC;Are you shaking?
1275;AH005DD;I'll cover the wounded!
2031;AQ005Z;Aaaaggh.
2058;AA049DA;I used to be the best pilot in the world.
1119;AE138_052;Roger, moving up.
1103;AE144_036;Enemies confirmed!
1300;AL032DC;Time for a rest.
1603;AL047BB;I still have some fight in me.
1691;AD006BD;Attack them once they're in range!
1874;AA053BA;Have you ever wondered why this would happen?
2006;AE153_043;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1163;AC023BB;Are we gonna fight?
1038;AM017AA;You're doing great!
1305;AM163DD;That's ridiculous!
1821;AJ005BD;Someone contact the headquarters!
1407;AS003EE;Whoa!
463;AZ020J;Fire!
1639;AM145BB;You read too many comic books.
1342;AE186_001;ENEMY NEST AHEAD!
1479;AA057BA;I'll give you something good later.
2136;AT006BC;I'm stuck in the web! Help me!
2106;AE202_072;You should keep your opinions to yourself.
1481;AR006Y;I'll let the med ignore our position!
854;AE020X;BRING IT!
1844;AN022AC;It's my honor to fight with a hero.
3825;AE146_038;It's just a matter of time before they find me, please save me!
1319;AN026DB;Don't worry, I'm here.
1178;AM148BB;IT'S POSSIBLE!
915;AI012BB;So unlucky!
4499;AE112_041;The aliens plan to exterminate us with monsters, but I'm gonna put an end to it!
2078;AE138_009;Infantry, use the heavy tanks as cover.
1426;AE137_007;GET UNDER THE ENEMY SHIPS!
1099;AI001DC;The wings are abnormal!
1429;AM135BD;Yeah, you could say that.
1106;AE100_011;That was close.
6957;AU132Y;Please don't set us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
2902;AE121_022;If the drones attack us right now, we'll get wiped out!
1089;AL004DD;E-D-F!
1567;AE153_029;A backup is not here yet?!
4176;AE125_024;We suffered heavy casualties. Everybody died in the artillery fire.
1369;AY032BA;I'm very sad.
1115;AO004AC;Magazine change!
1887;AF008BD;Captain, request permission to fire.
598;AM010AB;Good job!
1650;AN023BA;You're lucky. I'll help you.
1796;AD010AB;They're out of range! Let's get closer!
898;AM016DA;I'm impressed!
1694;AE035BE;I'll make you a side dish!
1683;AA065BD;Why did you join the EDF?
1263;AO031BD;SWAP THE GUARDRAGE!
2068;AN024DB;I'll protect you. That's my task.
1591;AO004BB;I'll swap my magazines!
2629;AA003Y;Fighting without knowing anything. Can't believe it.
903;AA043BA;Do you think we'll win?
1604;AZ006L;Missile Launch Tube Opened!
765;AE100_027;Don't you quit!
2704;AA025BC;I will barbecue with my kids on the weekend.
3998;AE146_014;STAY AWAY FROM ME! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
840;AQ005DC;I got shot!
1018;AY036BE;I can't believe it.
909;AR002BD;CAPTAIN!
966;AN009BB;Let's fight together.
1154;AE208_001;What are THOSE?
2223;AB006X;Got it! Move! Move!
1275;AP016DA;Hit! Did you see that?
1979;AEX04_468;IT'S THE DEATH, QUEEN!
2791;AZ001K;This is Phobos, ready to attack again.
3488;AEX04_489;Those heavy-armored grays are armed to the teeth! Be careful!
877;AE186_003;Commencing attack!
10164;AE106_009;But under certain circumstances, the drones will turn red. Red-coloured drones are in combat mode. They are killing machines that can trace and kill their targets.
1933;AA060DB;What is the reason you joined the EDF?
2812;AE140_012;This is Grim Reaper, we're coming to help, hang in there!
1062;AR019DC;Did someone get shooed up?
1379;AM147DC;I want to be famous.
7627;AU021AC;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise
1365;AJ012BE;Where's the new commander?
1727;AE186_057;The nest has been destroyed.
930;AM079DA;That's not true.
1755;AE041BD;It's gettin' more interesting!
2109;AA131BA;It's hard to control a powered exoskeleton.
1385;AE105_043;WE'D BETTER EVACUATE!
2679;AA017Y;My leave's been cancelled. Can I file a complaint?
1750;AN008BB;You're lucky. I'll help you.
1362;AE103_047;Look up! Pylons!
710;AT112DC;Help!
1451;AD006CB;Attack the incoming enemy!
1629;AR002AA;HOW DARE YOU SHOOT MY MEN!
1314;AA003AB;Always be prepared for battle.
1643;AA025CA;Remember to stay elegant.
2331;AA016ZA;Always check how much power you have left.
1958;AA127BA;I can't imagine we'll lose.
2095;AZ012J;CONFIRMED. Entering the combat area.
1156;AR014DB;One diver died!
1454;AK002BC;The enemy has been confirmed!
709;AM118DB;Let's do it!
2026;AF009V;Don't shoot yet. Need to get closer.
2277;AY041BA;I'm nothing special, but I'm at your service.
2469;AA090BD;I want to go back before I freak out!
4030;AEX04_568;This is Ranger 7, offering unit and combat fire support!
2623;AE210_124;Find the spot that isn't protected by the golden armor!
6770;AU162AA;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1604;AE142_029;Could it be monsters underground?
2313;AD010V;Confirm the enemy's position with your eyes!
483;AM040AC;Stop it!
855;AM023ZA;I'm against it!
1691;AE012BD;Don't look down on me!
974;AG002BC;THEY FOUND US!
683;AH016BB;Are you hurt?
3825;AT306BB;Did you destroy the web? Thank you for saving my life.
1191;AT001AC;GAAAAH!
1869;AR038BD;My- My buddy is dead!
970;AM076BA;What if I could?
1001;AM004ZA;Check the damage!
2350;AA009BD;It's just pulling the trigger. Piece of cake.
1947;AI008DA;Shock Absorber! Condition 4!
848;AE179_057;Monsters
1519;AE149_028;We've destroyed the Deroy!
1169;AM047Y;Somebody said that too!
1463;AR013AA;It'll be crowded in hell!
4854;AE202_014;Monsters incoming! Seems like a subspecies of aggressive alien species Gamma!
1163;AM140DD;I've made up my mind.
5312;AE107_017;No, you're wrong. Monsters are everywhere in the world, not just here.
1432;AE174_018;Missiles incoming!
1483;AO012DD;Cool Down starts now!
4048;AEX04_508;That light barrier will reflect our attack. We just have to move closer.
1583;AE200_022;Diver 3, attack!
782;AM088BA;That's the truth.
1867;AEX04_156;Missile entering combat area!
1473;AA002DC;I'm better than anyone else.
1926;AJ005BC;Someone contact the headquarters!
1348;AS001AC;AHHHHH!
3246;AZ001N;Barren Land to Air Raiders. Launch preparations are complete.
6814;AE202_059;Mothership 10 that landed in South America has destroyed Shelter A. We've lost over half our supplies.
2187;AEX04_652;Grim Reaper, we're counting on you.
1143;AE007BA;DROP DEAD!
1063;AM055BA;The answer is yes.
567;AM014X;Got it!
1004;AP007DA;Hit confirmed!
1725;AA092BA;The enemy must be hiding somewhere.
1319;AM046W;We agree with each other!
1177;AO011DA;Ready for cool down!
1445;AK005DC;The sensor has caught the enemy!
1334;AN008BE;You're lucky, I'll help you.
591;AE143_008;Copy that!
1223;AB013DC;I'm tired to death!
1523;AG015BC;The fight starts now!
1439;AD011BE;They're almost in range!
2325;AT309BC;Thanks to the hero that came to my rescue!
2041;AI006BD;Oh no! We need healing!
3770;AE179_009;There should be some emergency power for us to open this blast door!
840;AM098BA;That's the truth!
1305;AE147_035;A new type of weapon?
1890;AT007DC;Attack that thread-spitting creature!
994;AM049CB;That's not right!
1903;AT002X;Oh crap! These webs!
524;AY001DA;Thanks!
7598;AU141Y;Farewell my comrades, the time has come It's over now, my love and my family are all gone
1365;AY007DD;I owe you big!
1193;AM143BA;Can we change the subject?
2657;AM082X;What if I said I want to help people? Would that be weird?
1039;AA033BB;Come back alive!
4246;AE162_029;Arcalus! Humankind's biggest enemy! It's finally going down!
687;AD003BB;INCOMING!
870;AO003BC;Reload!
2831;AI001Z;Am I going to die here? Crap.
3040;AEX04_299;CONFIRMED! MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ARCULUS!
5454;AE174_027;We presume those legs with different length were designed to best fit various terrains and targets.
1526;AE004_056;There were more in the air!
1737;AE190_016;Attack! Attack!
1019;AE007W;I'll back you up!
1992;AE194_025;The mothership is gaining altitude.
790;AE159_067;RETREAT!
890;AD009DD;Ready to shoot!
1823;AJ005BA;Someone contact the headquarters!
1910;AT104BC;I can't get out!
1743;AM146BA;You play too many video games.
1649;AA069DC;We can barely fly underground.
1006;AN011DC;We're joining your team.
2011;AEX04_522;Teleportation ships incoming!
1274;AG016BD;IT'S SHOWTIME!
502;AQ002ED;AHHH!
2508;AA043X;Isn't there an underground exploration allowance?
6787;AE141_090;Five thousand aliens are closing in on Beijing. We'll round up our forces to beat them in the suburbs of Beijing.
1608;AE025BA;That's what I'm waiting for!
769;AM095BA;That's right!
1829;AC002DA;We are ready to engage the fight!
3110;AE157_008;This is Scout. Numerous aliens have landed in the thick fog.
1878;AE106_026;Save our man and get out of here now!
1496;AC011BD;I WILL SURVIVE!
973;AA073BC;It's so dark.
2692;AE122_017;Pretty good! It's the first time someone's better than me!
1036;AE143_014;Well good luck with that!
1792;AE028V;EVAPORATE NOW!
4113;AE146_040;Are you thinking about breaking through the enemy defense? That's reckless!
385;AB005ZA;HUH?!
964;AM115BC;You're wrong.
1076;AY005BC;I owe you my life.
915;AM079DB;That's not true.
2057;AL001ZA;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
670;AB004AC;FOLLOW ME!
1326;AG007V;We are found! Shoot!
552;AM035CA;Correct!
785;AM077Y;I owe you one!
2011;AT002Z;I'm stuck! Kill that thing!
2043;AI007AC;It's no big deal.
7694;AU171DA;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
1349;AD021DB;CONFIRM SHOOTING RANGE!
619;AH020BE;WE ARE HIT!
1700;AF018DD;Why don't we just shoot them dead?
1031;AY030BA;That was close.
1619;AA013CA;Dodge first, attack later.
1090;AA048DB;Is there someone you like?
4192;AE137_004;Good, attack those teleportation ships. Take down as many as possible.
1437;AR019DD;Did someone get chewed up?
1143;AC013BB;The fight is starting!
1389;AE135_005;RUN! HURRY!
3930;AE203_014;We cannot win this fight! Let's take out as many of those bastards as we can!
920;AS004AA;ATTACK IT!
957;AE132_016;ADVANCE!
656;AL009X;CLEAR!
941;AK004AC;We have company!
784;AC001X;I'm ready.
359;AM046AB;Fine.
2619;AA061BE;It's too dangerous! Do you still want to fight?
1445;AF006DA;Let's draw closer to the enemy.
739;AE027X;SWEET!
726;AM059DB;That's right.
1102;AE100_003;Make a turn here!
3951;AE190_031;Commencing artillery strike. All ground units stay clear of target area.
882;AY039BD;All yours.
3326;AF032BC;Attack in silence. That's what the best soldiers do.
627;AM041BB;Definitely.
2157;AA112BC;Looks like the war situation is in our favor.
994;AM024BE;Respect!
736;AT110DC;Break the web!
2297;AE202_069;God came from egg-shaped ships.
1559;AM116BC;Don't say stupid things.
4019;AE107_020;Large flying saucers are appearing everywhere. They keep dropping monsters.
2425;AA011ZA;The uniform has superb functions, but...
3311;AA013W;I've always admired the soldiers in the movies, and I still do.
657;AQ006BE;Gah!
2096;AT204BB;Don't give up! I'm coming to save you!
2037;AS003DD;HEEEEEEELP!
815;AY006BD;I'm in your debt.
1374;AE145_036;Humanoid robots
4899;AE177_019;The enemy space suits are very tough! Concentrator attacks on a single spot!
2286;AE146_052;Thank you for making it out here, I'm grateful.
753;AY072BA;We'll figure it out.
1597;AL005ZA;YEAH!
3200;AA021DB;With the power of the plasma drive, this kind of enemy is nothing.
531;AZ010L;FIRE!
376;AY050BC;Goodbye.
1038;AM047V;WOAH!
1133;AE008DB;Leave this one to me!
1864;AN030BE;Wow! It's you!
1644;AE199_032;EXTERMINATE THE MUTANTS!
1713;AC025BA;I'll be the one who kills the most enemies.
1687;AE127_037;STAY AWAY FROM ME, BACK OFF!
3798;AE210_108;After saving my butt so many times, I can finally return the favor!
2325;AA006W;It's a situation that never happened before.
1717;AE107_010;These monsters are tough!
1770;AEX04_604;Sniper team, lock on target!
2118;AT310DB;It's my privilege to be saved by you!
1324;AJ008DB;We can't keep staying here!
3388;AA032BD;If I had known this would happen, I would have done my training seriously.
2695;AE105_077;Sergeant, take the civilians to a safe place.
702;AE006DB;Attack!
466;AY050BA;Goodbye!
3701;AA104BD;I used to be a security guard. Somehow I became a soldier.
6912;AU132BD;Please don't send us on these grave missions, we're done with these expeditions!
3300;AE159_021;Why?! Do they have a nest here?!
2087;AE033BC;I'M INVINCIBLE!
3070;AE114_080;Looks like the aliens can regenerate their bodies too!
1885;AA090BA;I wanna go back before I freak out!
1240;AEX04_046;Two enemies left!
5428;AA021BE;I've applied to join logistics support missions. Maybe this is my last time on the front line.
1656;AY021BE;Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
2599;AE120_004;Only we, the Spriggan, can complete this mission.
4087;AE145_030;Is the mothership planning to turn this place into an alien colony?
527;AZ019O;FIRE!
4056;AZ002L;This is submarine aircraft carrier Epimetheus. We already surfaced.
1569;AL034DC;I'm going home to sleep.
1029;AM149DB;Because I'm pretty?
2625;AE119_050;Regroup! We're fighting back now!
575;AT302CB;Thank you.
1392;AL008Y;D-D-F!
795;AM009BE;DON'T MOVE!
1898;AE135_004;You okay? Leave them to us!
1076;AE003_009;The armor's melting!
3967;AE210_035;If all eleven motherships gang up on us, we will be vaporized in no time.
785;AP008BB;Nice hit!
1675;AE105_022;More flying saucers incoming!
2167;AT202AA;DESTROY THE NET! SAVE OUR GUYS!
820;AM168BE;Thank you, sir!
1488;AEX04_502;THAT'S THE SHIELD BEARERS!
1445;AC015BE;Looks like the fight will be violent.
723;AN002BA;I'll back you up.
1398;AY065DC;I will never do that again.
4328;AE145_010;There's an elevated railway right ahead. Spread out over there and search for enemies.
3777;AE141_051;Targeting in three, two, one, fire!
1027;AE171_038;Arcalis got hit!
1899;AF008BB;Captain, request permission to fire.
1479;AEX04_041;One more alien out there!
4541;AE202_013;More monsters confirmed! A subspecies of aggressive alien species, Gamma!
633;AQ004BE;Gah!
4064;AE160_022;Mission complete! Good job, guys!
430;AE181_005;WHAT?!
2647;AN011CB;The legendary captain! It can't be!
748;AE174_003;Ready to shoot!
1794;AE176_065;I don't think that's the case.
2495;AT002AB;I'm caught in the web! Get me out of this!
2087;AA061AB;Show them the power of heavy weapons!
2182;AEX04_281;CONFIRMED! ALIEN IN HEAVY ARMOR!
2585;AE104_046;Watch the sky! Pylons are crashing down!
2954;AD002X;I'm coming for you. Get into the shooting range.
1351;AM191BD;I did it out of spontaneity.
1259;AB008BD;Hey, let's run!
1896;AO017BE;BULLETS! BULLETS!
1616;AE143_018;There's another one coming down!
1354;AE186_023;ATTACK!
2597;AF013BC;They didn't even notice us, we're winning!
647;AE023AB;ARMSHOT!
1052;AE211_011;Is it armed?
3444;AE115_007;Class dismissed! Let's get down to business!
785;AD001BA;The enemy's here!
727;AH015BD;ARE YOU SHOT?
1071;AH010AA;We'll get you a medic!
2005;AM157BB;Let's talk about it next time!
1223;AE019DC;DIE FROM MY DANCE!
3134;AE115_019;The aliens have completely taken over this place. Stay alert!
4223;AE177_005;That base is taken by the enemies. It's very dangerous for sure.
1739;AA081DC;I'm really good at flying at night.
1589;AF029BE;They didn't see us.
1111;AC003BE;I'll show you what I have.
919;AM088BE;That's the truth.
1347;AL011BD;E.D.F.!
2166;AE155_017;PROCEED! COVER THE CITIZENS!
1087;AM048Y;It said on TV!
1255;AM207BC;Oh, my.
1975;AE148_010;THEY'RE WALKING OVER THE BUILDINGS!
2000;AO027BC;Reload! No need to cover me!
962;AM108DD;No worries.
1838;AA025CB;Remember to stay elegant!
1812;AR018DB;Someone got chewed up!
1095;AM096BA;You're not mistaken!
1225;AZ015H;Start bombing!
1284;AE002_169;There are more than I thought!
2732;AZ025PB;The creator of this weapon must be a genius.
1279;AA071BC;What is your purpose?
1558;AL032BA;We took out the last one!
1308;AE127_030;MORE COMING!
820;AL015CA;We did it!
956;AM095DC;That's not true!
3107;AA094BD;I'm not afraid of the enemy, but the darkness.
3916;AE107_051;Civilian, this time I will definitely take you to a safe place.
2331;AT003BA;It's pulling me away! It's so strong!
1048;AM028Z;We'll do this!
947;AM165BB;Let me thank you.
2188;AE210_128;Confirmed hit on the command ship.
1747;AL044BE;I'm hurt! Can I go home?
731;AM061CA;It happens.
1231;AA058DD;Why did you enlist?
1091;AG009DC;The enemy is coming!
2844;AF007AA;If the enemy is too careless, now's the best timing.
2106;AD015BD;Pretty close, but still out of range.
1029;AE005BD;Let's go to hell!
1661;AF018BA;If you fire, they will see us.
1238;AM080BB;That's absolutely right.
985;AO004DA;Power control!
952;AZ016I;Target confirmed.
4275;AE162_033;So it left simply because it got bored. Shit.
1566;AK006CB;NEW ENEMIES CONFIRMED!
1781;AA099BA;If only I could make it back alive.
1811;AE166_016;Never-before-seen enemies!
1896;AE205_033;Assemble the strike team right now.
2490;AF013CA;Keep down the power, or they'll find us.
1249;AS006BE;Somebody help!
2486;AA015BE;We must crack down on illegal immigrants.
935;AE008BE;Go to hell!
5770;AE001_005;The base will open up to the public in the afternoon. Visitors will watch a flying show at the end of their tour.
1004;AM013Y;I understand, sir.
775;AE005W;PLEASE HIT!
2194;AR010DC;Huh? CAPTAIN!
2412;AZ003J;This is Bummer, re-entering the combat area.
2460;AEX04_423;The threads will entangle you if you get too close!
1185;AE145_025;Advance one block!
451;AM056BA;YES
2710;AE103_030;Attack the upper part of the pylon and destroy it!
1637;AM144BD;Was it in your dreams?
1023;AK002DA;Enemy confirmed!
1912;AE206_007;Only a lunatic would come out here!
1994;AR041BB;How dare you shoot my men!
1125;AO011CB;Ready for cool-down!
1919;AE131_052;Stop. No need to move forward.
1714;AA033DD;Shock absorber, normal.
892;AQ003AC;Stop!
1219;AE006_009;MONSTERS!
1173;AE007BB;DROP DEAD!
1636;AL049BB;Time to find the next enemy!
1184;AP016BB;Took one down!
4033;AE180_029;Barga is weak against small and fast enemies! Go support it!
1768;AE105_058;There are just way too many!
1915;AM127BD;Look carefully! You're wrong!
3096;AE111_023;Isn't there a way to shoot down the teleportation ships?
6693;AU142AB;Here still I will fight the endless scream There's no one home to wait for me
1091;AK017BE;This is hopeless!
2208;AE117_064;What on earth is up ahead?
1408;AI006ZA;Spriggans are immortal!
813;AF029BA;They didn't see us.
791;AD008BA;INCOMING!
1753;AS016BA;Take down this guy!
1419;AH014BD;I'll check on your wound later!
909;AE158_016;LET'S JUMP!
472;AQ005AC;AHHH
1316;AM055BB;The answer is yes!
1066;AC019BD;Can't stop shaking?
2404;AEX04_213;This rain will impair your vision. Be careful.
2212;AA008BC;Is just fighting. Easy.
1379;AJ004DB;We lost our commander!
1257;AEX04_160;Secure nearby area!
1831;AE002_100;Where the hell do those things come from?
1015;AM021BE;We can't lose!
1235;AE016BA;Swallow this!
623;AO001BE;LOADING!
3923;AA092DD;But it seems that aerial units were supposed to be military technology.
2049;AEX04_374;CONFIRMED! NEW MONSTER SPECIES!
1513;AA026DA;Stabilizer, all normal.
1714;AE020DB;Behold, the dance of death!
3709;AEX04_405;The red one doesn't spit acid, but it still is dangerous.
1580;AEX04_461;They're way bigger than us!
1910;AT201BD;No, no! Someone is caught!
1863;AC021BE;Stay calm. I have to stay calm.
764;AM089X;Oh my.
1819;AT103BC;Set me free! Set me free!
1250;AEX04_161;Defend this location!
1580;AE140_025;Looks like you're having fun.
1418;AK020BE;ENEMY RESPONSE IS SPOTTED
1779;AE168_003;Let's go eliminate the monsters!
3710;AA142BB;I used private powered exoskeletons for cargo shipment before.
1405;AS013BE;Somebody help me!
2450;AE146_060;But I wonder what they did to the city.
1530;AA018BA;Bullets can never hit me!
1270;AE174_007;MASTER ARM ON!
2032;AE033BD;I'M INVINCIBLE!
3225;AEX04_248;Isn't it to our disadvantage if we engage the monsters in the dark?
2729;AT003BC;It's pulling me away! It's so strong!
1007;AK002DC;Enemy confirmed!
1671;AZ039Q;Civilian, get on the vehicle.
1748;AE122_001;Red color drones confirmed.
3147;AE001_044B;This is an emergency! The base is being attacked by monsters!
774;AA036BA;Do your best.
1671;AE168_025;Aeronea is spinning its web!
950;AL013V;You did it!
1630;AA001EC;AHAHAHAHAHA!
1193;AEX04_439;A FLYING MONSTER!
2678;AE141_063;There must be some areas that are left unprotected.
1386;AE113_016;Protect the civilians!
2272;AA016DB;I think this equipment is best for fighting monsters.
4253;AE153_015;It's useless destroying the spacesuits! We have to hit those aliens inside!
364;AY023BB;Heh heh.
2209;AA063DC;Why would people like you...
2031;AA138BC;How can we lose to the wing divers?
1669;AE121_043;Beware of those large cannons!
2280;AE003_031;We can't reach the corporal in charge of the escort.
1496;AE002_098;Monsters are coming from the hole!
1765;AE002_139;Man, that was scary.
1851;AT104BD;Bastard! I can't get out!
1687;AA053DD;That guy keeps looking at me.
1329;AD014AC;Confirm the target enemy!
3534;AZ001PB;Congrats, now you know the top secret of EDF.
1925;AEX04_304;CONFIRMED NEW ENEMY TYPE
1977;AEX04_361;Confirmed. Longtide Deroy.
1301;AG004AC;FIRE!
2026;AJ005BB;Someone contact the headquarters!
3154;AF032BB;Attack in silence. That's what the best soldiers do.
2114;AE130_023;Aliens are coming out from the base!
1998;AE115_030;But they can regenerate instantly!
6794;AU122AC;We shall not allow these aliens to rule we homo sapiens!
1406;AE004_048;AHHH!
947;AG008DB;They found us!
16650;AE115_002;I saw their faces. They have two eyes on their face. Like humans, they see things with their eyes, and we can use this against them. I don't think they're able to attack something they can't see. So when they attack us, we just hide in the shadows of buildings.
2474;AL003DC;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2051;AL011BB;E-D-F!
549;AM031BA;Yes sir!
710;AA050AB;Go carefully!
653;AM160BC;You saved me.
3393;AE176_062;If we can mass produce it, it may change the tides of war.
1975;AEX04_097;Hooligan cannon, open fire!
1315;AEX04_456;Look how fast it is!
2216;AC025BD;I'll be the one who kills the most enemies.
1291;AA007BD;I never lose.
4473;AE211_014;God? That's a Primer God for all I know. We don't need it.
1452;AM114BB;That's absolutely wrong.
1036;AM181BE;This is for honor!
2226;AA017DC;Wing divers even have dietary rules.
2284;AE186_036;Does that mean the flying types are multiplying?
2271;AN001Z;A civilian, what are you doing here?
1167;AO010AB;Cartridge change
2579;AE112_027;We can still make it! Run for your lives!
710;AM001V;You alright?
2860;AE184_009;Aranea has built a nest on the teleportation anchors!
2513;AE119_022;All we can do now is fight! Fire at will!
2676;AE159_071;Too many flying type. All teams retreat now.
1981;AA008Y;Come on, someone has to clear things up.
2302;AE198_047;AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
1294;AM124BB;Don't be stupid!
1673;AK008DD;I feel an enemy nearby!
6666;AU032CB;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, Soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
2176;AI020BE;I'VE SEEN WORSE! THIS IS NOTHING!
1700;AD006DD;Asking for permission to attack!
1243;AM022BB;GENIUS!
1210;AI005CB;I'm about to crash!
3558;AE004_037;This is Gamma Team! We are engaging an alien infantry unit!
1498;AE037BC;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
2729;AE176_034;AFV, create a line of defense and cover the infantry.
926;AE054BA;ATTACKING NOW!
1460;AC020DB;I'll show you my techniques!
1390;AE191_011;DESTROY THE MACHINERY!
2357;AE114_039;Something is descending from the flying ship!
691;AM068AA;Whoa!
1279;AG008BA;The enemy has seen us!
641;AS005BA;HOLY-
1673;AA005DD;I'll fly higher next time.
3339;AE164_019;Save the mothership for later! Destroy the enemies around first!
775;AE005Y;You're a goner!
2383;AZ027PA;You have good taste, Air Raider.
7171;AE202_068;According to Indian mythology, egg-shaped ships descended from the skies and out from within came God.
2173;AE136_017;EMC, fire at full power!
608;AQ004DD;I'm hit!
2342;AD004DA;We'll launch the attack once they get into range!
1378;AI011BB;WE NEED RESCUE!
1117;AM118BA;It's only your fantasy.
4389;AE105_073;Leave the gigantic ship to the Air Force! Ground troops! Shoot down the drones!
2850;AE153_022;We got surrounded! Request for reinforcements!
1777;AT202AB;Destroy the net! Save our guys!
1743;AE111_007;They could shoot threads!
2199;AF019BC;Once you fire, they will see us.
3694;AA032BE;If I had known this would happen, I would have done my training seriously!
860;AM106DC;I know!
540;AM049DC;Forget it.
2117;AT105CB;It's a trap! Just run!
1573;AR027BD;The newcomer got chewed up!
1967;AT001DB;I can't fly
985;AE158_017;DIVE!
860;AE210_080;GET COVER!
1817;AA098BA;Let me breathe the air outside.
1917;AEX04_272;CONFIRMED! FLYING AGGRESSOR!
1307;AA017AC;Just focus on your duties.
6560;AU162DD;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
2150;AE161_022;The opponents are tough, stay sharp!
541;AM059BC;No way!
1147;AG007AA;Engage
1203;AM094DB;Wrong from the start.
775;AP023BE;We did it!
2848;AA031BE;Our superiors' operation plans are perfect.
723;AM038DD;Understood!
1111;AM002CB;The wound is nothing!
669;AO003AC;Reloading
1517;AO010BE;OH NO! I'M OUT OF AMMO!
582;AS006FB;Help!
922;AD003W;Ready to shoot!
753;AM130DC;I love you.
701;AY015BB;I'm back.
2026;AS015BD;SOMEBODY KILL THIS GUY!
721;AM014W;Affirmative.
2303;AT304CB;Did you destroy the web? Thanks.
2379;AA015Y;There are more weirdos in the military than I expected.
502;AE173_008;DAMN
1663;AH010BB;The medical check on you later!
1235;AM113DA;I'm not interested.
3008;AE178_025;Air Force has gained control of the air. They will come for support.
3183;AA139BB;It's my first time to use the military-powered exoskeleton.
1812;AE197_005;Confirmed to drop teleportation anchor.
804;AM001BA;HOLD ON!
1810;AEX04_390;M-MONSTERS!
1538;AE118_017;Our bullets are useless!
2458;AR040BC;Victim there's a victim
900;AG014BB;Coming this way!
2089;AM146DB;Because I'm too poor to feed myself.
4811;AE131_043;It's you. This mission is going to be dangerous. I'll have your back.
1136;AE176_053;Arcalus is approaching!
2014;AE062BA;I don't wanna die! Not now!
3258;AZ032J;End of bombing. Air Raider, I'll leave the rest to you.
772;AN024BA;Let's go together.
1194;AC021DC;I'll show you my moves!
1525;AY021DA;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
1410;AE104_035;Pylons are crashing down!
977;AB014BE;What's the rush?
1985;AE051BB;NOW, ATTACK THE ARMS!
3580;AE186_044;What? A queen? It's a queen!
1571;AE183_001;We've discovered a winged alien!
7655;AU171V;Now hold up your head and laugh and taunt On the front we are the brave heroes and we fight on
2467;AE138_047;But we'll ask for your favor in return someday.
1428;AA003FB;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
720;AM065DB;I see.
800;AP008BC;Nice hit!
1357;AP011BA;I TOOK ONE DOWN!
2003;AE211_036;It can distort space!
5469;AE211_087;Humanity's last stand. We've deployed everyone into the fight to stop the mother ships.
465;AM026AA;Yeah!
724;AQ009BD;I've been hit!
510;AB004CA;GO!
1509;AD014AA;CONFIRM THE TARGET ENEMY!
1505;AM077BB;That's why we're in trouble!
642;AM009CB;That's great!
1279;AJ001DA;Please send backup!
2093;AC010AB;The enemy is around. The battle will soon begin.
1804;AF014CB;Don't shoot until the order's given.
1975;AD007AA;Hold your fire until they get in range!
2053;AA087DA;I might go crazy before I beat the enemy!
588;AH001DC;Watch out!
1415;AE155_004;PROTECT THE CIVILIANS!
3331;AE134_013;This is Scout. The teleportation ships are dispatching aliens!
1328;AE128_002;Prepare for battle!
3469;AL007X;E-D-F! E-D-F!
314;AM044BA;Got it!
1386;AY077BA;Hey, we're buddies!
2215;AA042AB;EDF is not afraid of the dark.
2615;AE174_009;Nix 3, Master Arm, on!
1075;AE144_005;THEY'RE COMING!
30539;AE202_051;This is Brooklyn, New York. Joel from the Resistance speaking. We've lost every fighting man and woman in the area. There are currently 200 people hiding in secure locations, mostly elderly and children. We're slowly running out of water and food, but this is not a call for rescue. We are committed to fight till the end. We are only common civilians, but we have started our military training. We just want to let you know that we will hold our ground. Brooklyn, New York, over.
1534;AE159_019;Oh come there's so many of them!
1369;AM080BD;That's absolutely right.
1585;AC022BE;I'm okay. I'm not shaking.
733;AP014BC;One killed!
952;AE132_018;Monsters
1092;AI015DA;I think I'm done!
701;AQ004CB;I'M HIT!
6689;AU022W;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
3762;AE163_024;Confirmed to be some kind of flying object, unable to identify.
1580;AD009CB;Confirm distance with the enemy!
2261;AE128_041;We still can't let the enemy break through here.
937;AP005CA;Took one down!
1069;AD008DC;Entering the range.
3413;AE146_032;Sergeant! You alright? Sergeant!
1923;AEX04_356;CONFIRMED! GIGANTIC ANCHOR!
1772;AT305CA;You destroyed the net. Well done.
3403;AE176_028;Everything went well. Time to wipe out the rest of the enemies!
1794;AI006BE;Oh no! We need healing!
650;AM168BC;Thank you, sir!
2718;AZ026Q;Vehicle dropped. Hope all ground forces are doing well.
3483;AA118BC;Became a soldier only for the pension. I regret it now.
1302;AR023BB;Damn it! He died!
3580;AA116BB;I finally understand. It's no use to run away.
2086;AE145_074;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
781;AZ016O;Ready to beam!
1633;AM190BE;Because I want money and fame!
816;AM085BE;That makes sense.
1947;AE174_020;Look at those long legs!
894;AP005AA;I DEFEATED IT!
3003;AA034W;We have to eliminate our enemy in a planned way.
637;AO002CB;Reload!
1831;AE015CB;Wing Diver for the win!
957;AM093DA;Don't tell anyone.
2007;AE208_009;The gigantic anchor has been destroyed!
4832;AE122_004;Don't underestimate the drones. The fact they're only machines makes them even more terrifying weapons.
2322;AT003V;KILL THE THING THAT IS SHOOTING THREADS!
915;AE100_023;Focus!
6839;AU022DD;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
2096;AE145_006;They even sent out the mothership!
2085;AA099BB;If only I could make it back alive.
3305;AA037W;My friends were blown away, so I'll blow them away.
1775;AE143_013;They want us to dodge the anchors!
817;AE179_029;I hear something.
1349;AL019DA;Enter the cool-down mode!
1504;AN004AB;Don't worry, I'll protect you.
989;AM006DB;Stay strong!
1325;AL002DA;YEAH!
2182;AJ008BD;Somebody help us
2996;AE001_023;Don't worry, soldiers love making jokes like these.
832;AS002AC;LET GO!
1103;AG004X;IT'S SHOWTIME!
2134;AI008DD;Shock absorber, condition four!
1798;AE162_007;Shoot down the teleportation ships!
3995;AZ032H;Balling complete! Aerator! Still alive?
1318;AZ018J;It's clear, civilian.
1248;AM016DD;I'm impressed!
1413;AE197_021;An anchor is dropping down!
2007;AL044BD;I'm hurt. Can I go home?
3654;AE211_110;Not even Storm One can do anything about that monster!
3403;AA021DA;With the power of the plasma drive, this kind of enemy is nothing.
1000;AE162_002;We're losing our men.
3761;AT109DC;This is Wing Diver! Request for support!
2020;AF031BE;The tension gives me the thrills!
2083;AR003DC;Captain! Please respond!
2125;AE059BB;AHHHHH!!!
1172;AL030BA;We're invincible!
1235;AK005Z;This looks like fun!
1471;AE129_025;Destroy the teleportation ship!
1466;AE019DA;DIE FROM MY DANCE!
4918;AE203_018;A teleportation ship was shot down. Unbelievable!
1889;AS003ED;TTHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1968;AH026BB;Captain, I won't let you die!
1293;AD002BC;The enemy is closing in!
1113;AE046BA;Attack your left!
1271;AM044CA;Completely wrong.
2099;AEX04_286;CONFIRMED! TELEPORTATION SHIP!
1316;AB013DA;I'm tired to death!
825;AP005AB;Defeated it!
484;AY049BE;Welcome!
531;AM033DC;Okay!
2103;AL006Z;E.D.F! E.D.F!
1137;AH005BB;I'll protect you!
1313;AL014DD;EXTERMINATED!
2802;AE145_029;There are numerous monsters and aliens under the mothership!
642;AC024DA;Let's go!
2749;AE211_098;The giant is radiating.
1656;AZ037G;Cruise missile, fire!
818;AE210_043;What's going on?
1195;AR032BA;GEORGE GOT SHOOT UP!
2003;AZ008N;Ballistic Missiles, Fire!
2524;AE003_025;Shoot them! Don't let the monsters get any closer!
2525;AA112BB;Looks like the war situation is in our favor.
386;AY044BE;Hello!
1282;AM122DC;Stop daydreaming!
3041;AA119BC;I don't want my pension anymore. I want to discharge.
4079;AE144_042;Many enemy robots landed in Russia. They're now engaged in heavy combat.
508;AH002DA;Dodge!
3031;AE145_013;Infantry, move! Don't let the enemy approach the overpass.
1816;AA045BE;Let's see who kills the most enemies.
690;AE005DC;SHOOT!
1672;AF003W;Looks like the enemy hasn't noticed us.
768;AG007AC;Engage!
2086;AL005V;AHHHHHHHHH!
1214;AT205BB;I'll destroy the web!
1652;AE108_005;AHHHHHHH!
2586;AF011AA;Let's knock them down quick and clean once we're close enough.
2506;AE107_045;You don't need to worry about your life after retirement.
1185;AE121_040;THEY'RE FIRING!
6497;AE170_020;You can't believe they've created such things just to destroy humankind. Those aliens really mean business.
1875;AR013DB;Reports! One diver fell!
739;AY042BA;Nice meeting you.
3152;AEX04_537;Urgentness! What a monstrosity!
988;AM132BC;Is that so?
1282;AB002BD;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
4195;AA094DC;I was just a civilian pilot. My friends all joined the EDF.
2554;AE164_008;There are just way too many shield bearers!
2319;AT304BE;Who destroyed the net? I must thank him.
1256;AE014X;I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD!
858;AD011DA;Move closer!
1272;AE001_018;Don't worry, it's fine.
786;AB003Z;Go, go!
802;AM038CA;Yeah, sure.
1677;AM199BB;I'll tell you in details later.
993;AE121_061;Fall back!
1256;AE014Z;You can't kill me!
2545;AR012AA;Don't bother the dead! Save those alive!
1694;AA090BE;I wanna go back before I freak out.
3659;AE173_012;It's monsters! They must be the ones that ate up the city residents!
1076;AC005CA;Detect the enemies!
4724;AA010ZA;Are looked down upon due to the uniform, all because we have to keep our equipment light.
1404;AH007BA;I WON'T LET YOU DIE!
6913;AU022DA;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives.
719;AY063BD;Forgive me.
1619;AEX01_008;Spriggan unit, what is that?
2065;AE150_018;Teleportation ship has been destroyed!
6835;AU012V;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold and raise your guns
884;AP022BA;H-HIT!
1577;AD008AA;Too far! Close in!
682;AD001Z;SPEARS!
631;AH013BC;Is it bad?
1616;AM156BD;We'll talk about it later!
1465;AE007DD;LET'S DESTROY THE TARGET!
1433;AK013BA;Did you hear something strange?
809;AC009BE;I can't die.
883;AE183_011;Tadpoles?
842;AN027DC;My pleasure.
2820;AE122_009;And they're fast, too! These things are tricky!
7632;AU021BD;It's only with our sacrifice That mankind can still exist down here in paradise.
918;AM007W;That's great!
471;AM153DD;Huh?
5185;AE113_004;This is a residential area! If we don't exterminate the monsters immediately, there will be casualties!
2656;AE117_059;It's no use! Permission to retreat!
777;AM081DC;You're wrong.
1804;AZ021G;Air raiders, I've got the sight
13531;AE211_060;That would be the peak of evolution for an organism, a life form which has reached its maximum potential. What does it take to evolve to such a degree? The process itself is beyond our imagination.
1469;AT105CA;It's a trap! Just run!
1372;AO005CB;Weapon Power Link!
585;AQ002DD;Ahh!
2135;AEX04_637;FENCER 6 HAS REACHED DESTINATION!
1523;AJ010BB;Should we really stay here?
1645;AM089BA;That's what the officer told us, too.
2220;AR039BB;Dead! My ally is dead!
964;AY061DB;I'll be more careful.
1263;AM023DD;I'll reward you later!
1408;AE055BA;Attacking the enemy now!
1546;AE167_013;IT'S FALLING DOWN!
2389;AM007AC;Pull the trigger! You can still manage this, right?
3148;AE004_039;Fall back! Fall back!
1296;AO005DB;Weapon Power, Link!
1144;AE011DB;Can you keep up with me?
24027;AE109_032;Many of you must be surprised, but this is a formal broadcast. This is not a promotion for a film or a TV show, nor a prank. We are currently at war with extraterrestrials. However, don't panic and stay calm. Currently, there is no countermeasure for this situation. Please stay tuned for updates. If evacuation is required in your area, there will be evacuation alarms.
2070;AE012AC;Don't hesitate! Just pull the trigger!
11177;AE113_041;Furthermore, we've identified a total of ten mother ships. They are scattered around the world and are continuously launching pylons. We must take down all ten of them!
3752;AE196_009;This is Spencer. We've engaged Aranea. Requesting backup.
1468;AT302BA;Thank you so much, comrade!
1648;AM149BB;That's probably the case!
1418;AA030AC;You WILL win, correct?
1700;AF026BD;How long before we can engage?
1145;AR019BE;ONE MAN DOWN!
1001;AE185_013;Kill them all!
708;AY071BE;It happens.
901;AM060BB;Impossible!
1457;AJ008DC;We can't keep staying here!
2432;AE175_008;We can't lose the air battle, no matter what!
2000;AA019BD;I can't possibly die.
1503;AE198_064;Heavy armored aliens in sight!
4707;AE113_007;The monsters have been confirmed to be species beta. They are tricky monsters that can shoot threads.
1235;AM214BD;I can't believe it!
578;AM081AC;WHAT THE-
26502;AE110_041;This is a war situation report. Although the EDF caused tremendous damage to the aliens, the battle is still continuing. We have the upper hand. Please do not be influenced by rumors. Stay calm and don't panic. There will be evacuation alarms in areas where evacuation is required. In order to act rapidly in case of evacuation, please start preparing your basic necessities and be ready.
1003;AM148BA;IT'S POSSIBLE!
3348;AA023AC;Leave tomorrow for tomorrow. Let's focus on how to win today first.
1700;AE176_012;Have a taste of my shotgun!
8969;AE002_159;I read about this in a sci-fi novel. In the story, a bunch of rats got into a spaceship that kept multiplying and they ended up eating all the food.
4176;AE205_025;This is Storm Free. We're here to rescue the damsels in distress.
975;AM063AC;You did a great job.
360;AM028DC;Yeah!
3834;AE106_029;Thank you so much, but what's a civilian doing here?
1128;AY046BB;Let's fight together!
1333;AE174_014;METEORITES!
4379;AZ040Q;It's for military use, but it's a case of emergency now, so let's just turn a blind eye to it.
1185;AA008CA;I can feel the wind.
3132;AE204_017;Those aliens are controlling the monsters! Attack the aliens!
1943;AA096DD;I have over 20 flying hours.
568;AE204_005;Retreat!
2214;AC025BE;I'll be the one who kills the most enemies.
1088;AM128DB;I'm really grateful.
1205;AJ016BA;WE NEED A CAPTAIN!
2143;AF002BC;Looks like the enemy can't find our location.
3164;AE162_030;Ugh... Arceus escaped.
1689;AE015AB;Relax! I'll bring you back safe!
725;AM070Y;Thank you, sir.
2570;AE198_059;This is Scout. Aliens coming from the right.
911;AD009ZA;ATTACK MODE!
793;AM065BA;That won't work.
701;AP008BE;Nice hit!
910;AM047DD;I refuse.
1467;AL010X;TURBANT NEUTRALIZED!
2545;AA017BC;Lucky today. The bullets won't hit me.
1889;AF011BA;Now is the time for a surprise attack!
3614;AE202_032;I understand. Leave it to us. We will try to weaken their forces.
1146;AM006CA;Wingdiver pride!
3599;AE141_048;This is Swallow 2. What took you so long? We're moving in!
630;AZ022I;Fire!
977;AE044BA;Go for the left!
645;AS001EB;AHHH!
531;AM044AB;Indeed.
1032;AM110BB;That couldn't be true.
1116;AE002_140;Let's move on!
2336;AE190_023;Take cover! Get behind the buildings!
838;AY023DA;Hahaha
912;AM205BE;Seriously?
724;AY070DA;Fine by me.
637;AK011DC;AGAIN?!
2090;AF002BB;Looks like the enemy can't find our location.
2274;AA107BE;Because I left the security company to enlist.
1028;AZ016Q;Move over the marker.
1096;AC013BD;The fight is starting.
1433;AEX04_583;Shotgunners, close in!
1339;AJ010BC;Should we really stay here?
1060;AM165DA;I don't believe it!
1230;AM101BD;It's common sense!
6101;AE103_026;It's the device on the top part of the pylon that is calling in the monsters! We might be able to stop it if we attack!
2469;AZ031PB;Why would a civilian know about this line?
1963;AM112DB;Can't we talk about things more interesting?
1167;AT006DC;GET ME OUT OF THE WEB!
757;AM009X;You're good!
1083;AB002V;STRAIGHT AHEAD!
751;AM046DD;Sorry.
4432;AEX04_215;The monsters won't be slowed down by the cold weather. Stay on alert!
2598;AE070BE;Look closer! We are E-D-F!
4940;AE125_007;Other teams are late, but there's no time to wait. Approach the artillery unit and take out as many as possible.
1757;AT111BD;Destroy the web!
1628;AB010BD;They want us to move forward!
4356;AE197_013;The calculations were 100% correct! We are right in the middle of their drop zone!
5413;AEX04_125;Fire countdown, three, two, one, fire!
1715;AEX04_645;Grim Reaper, going in!
1424;AE016BD;Swallow this!
6623;AU152AB;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
1762;AA005Y;Man, so many casualties.
2183;AE001_014;Emergency alert! Emergency alert!
1827;AE127_004;Show them what the blue jackets are made of!
1434;AM188BC;This is for love.
1975;AE178_044;Very well. Now move to underground.
2641;AE165_002;HAHAHAHA THESE BASTARDS LOOK WEAK!
1040;AM131BA;Don't say it now!
760;AM097DC;You're wrong!
3174;AE162_003;The EDF should put more effort into recruiting new personnel.
442;AM126DA;Thanks.
1248;AG001BC;LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FOUND!
1108;AK001BA;CONFIRM THE ENEMY!
2075;AG004AB;FIRE!!!
739;AM002DB;You alright?
1031;AI002DC;I'll put us dropping?
1034;AY018DD;Should be clear!
1781;AEX04_416;GLOWING MONSTERS CONFIRMED!
1397;AD020DB;Flying combat, ready!
773;AE182_002;Destroy it!
7724;AU121BD;Now pick up our weapons, off we go Firing at the flying saucer, shooting down our foe
4441;AE170_017;The sensors of those drones can still detect us in the rain. Remarkable tech.
1418;AA051BA;I'm the best singer.
1170;AM057X;It's not like that!
2646;AE197_015;Looks like a big anchor is being dropped from the sky!
1033;AM127DC;Thank goodness!
6964;AU132BB;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions!
1590;AC020BA;You remember what I told you yesterday?
981;AE053BE;We're in combat!
6424;AE202_023;So their purpose is to attack and multiply on Earth, just to spread the microorganisms across our planet.
901;AM124DB;You saved me.
1977;AN011V;Storm One! I'll leave it to you.
1617;AE133_018;There's more than one giant monster!
1318;AE203_005;THIS IS THE END!
640;AM054CB;Thank you!
1868;AEX04_018;Shit! We're surrounded!
6820;AE175_024;Now that the Queens have been wiped out, their nests are left unguarded. We'll soon devise a strategy to destroy the nests.
1915;AEX04_357;CONFIRMED! ENEMY LANDING SHIP!
2129;AEX04_408;THEY'RE EATING THE COCREATE BUILDINGS!
3817;AEX04_482;It's aliens and spacesuits! We got our work cut out for us!
2673;AE115_037;Is it really impossible to open talks with aliens?
636;AE163_032;Attack!
1806;AA047BE;I can make the best dishes in the world.
1121;AA064BD;Why did you enlist?
3308;AA038DD;I think it's because you've gained weight that you can't fly faster.
3393;AE154_010;That Mother Monster's attacks are too dangerous. Hide in the building at once.
876;AM073BE;Not possible!
953;AA040BE;Are you shaking?
624;AB011DA;Phew!
1122;AE040AC;WATCH OUT FROM BEHIND!
2068;AA028CB;Wingdivers can also fight underground.
1573;AE114_034;The Air Force will pursue it.
1301;AN014BB;I'm counting on you, Captain!
1759;AA042BC;Is there someone waiting for you at home?
1986;AEX04_108;Artillery unit will commence attack now.
2633;AT010BD;Do something to take down that thread spinning thing!
859;AA042DB;Didn't you sleep well?
2967;AE002_163;I'm going to the surface. Open the blast door.
1345;AM055X;Huh? Really?
1786;AF003BE;I think we can approach them now.
3671;AE106_015;First, humans reach closest point of approach distance.
1329;AE014DA;We can win this battle!
1907;AE069BB;DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HUMANS!
2512;AE171_018;Infantry unit, cover the powered exoskeletons!
1175;AN003BA;What are you doing, civilian?
6884;AU022BC;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
1704;AJ014BE;Who is our superior officer?
1218;AT202BC;Someone is caught in the web!
609;AM071AA;You sure?
704;AA036BB;Do your best.
4450;AE122_014;We can't deal with so many all at once, we must shoot them down one by one!
1683;AA001FB;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
1380;AM120DA;Let's change the subject!
2282;AE208_011;Gigantic Anchor successfully destroyed!
1239;AQ011BD;The armor is damaged?!
563;AE009DC;THIS WAY!
4299;AE172_004;Airstrikes can't break through the light barriers either! We have to do it ourselves!
2324;AZ004PA;System reboot, launch ready!
1130;AM163DA;THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
1565;AEX04_435;Aranea Nest spotted!
1626;AE159_017;DESTROY THE FLYING TYPE!
3885;AA092DA;But it seems that aerial units were supposed to be military technology.
1672;AE169_007;ATTACK THE GIANT MONSTER!
2830;AE205_014;Everyone, including the rescue team, will be wiped out!
610;AY049BA;Welcome!
692;AE161_009;ATTACK!
632;AM064Y;You said it!
6831;AU162AC;Yet we still keep fighting the good fight We trample our foes day and night
1456;AE139_008;That's a force to be reckoned with!
1316;AM092DB;Better keep it to yourself.
529;AM051BD;Hooah!
594;AO003AB;Reloading
2559;AA009BA;It's just pulling the trigger. Piece of cake.
7197;AU012DA;Hear us as we shout at the top of our lungs Be calm, be bold, and raise your guns
1481;AR022DB;This is unforgivable!
1254;AR002CB;You will pay for it!
3499;AEX04_708;Support vehicles will arrive any minute. Have the wounded get on the cars.
817;AY034DB;Sigh...
1732;AA066BD;Do you have any reasons to fight?
1335;AS002BD;AHHH!
2252;AE002_072;Anyways, just defeat the enemies!
1138;AO002BA;Reloading ammo
7552;AU161CB;This city has nothing but despair All we hear is silence now cause not a soul was spared
1148;AA062DD;Why are you here?
1074;AQ013BA;I'VE BEEN HIT!
2563;AA015BA;We must crack down on illegal immigrants.
1017;AB010DA;Let's fly!
1146;AM136DB;Thank you so much!
662;AE162_001;Let's move!
867;AM212BB;That can't be!
2250;AE198_031;Margate, I... I'm damaged!
3253;AEX04_216;Looks like the monsters are still active in this freezing cold!
1577;AZ013H;Hey! Wake up, everyone!
1028;AM141BA;You're so funny.
1932;AE194_011;We can't hold them off much longer!
6552;AU032BA;We shall spread our wings wide and fly high, soaring, gliding through the endless sky.
2000;AT308DA;Be gentle the next time you save me, okay?
1250;AY036BB;I can't believe it.
2293;AO025BB;Reload! I am so good at this!
672;AM045DC;I can't.
2055;AA085BA;I hate dark and narrow places.
2824;AT106BD;I can't get out I can't
2213;AE109_008;A huge swarm of monsters!
1768;AE128_064;What's the fun of raising monsters?
823;AA067BA;Why are you here?
2616;AEX04_612;A sniper team is standing by. Rendezvous with them.
6706;AU152BA;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
2515;AE199_012;The building just... WHAT'S GOING ON?!
4232;AA001DC;I train harder than anyone else, so I'll be fine. No doubt.
962;AE018DB;Look at me!
2597;AE160_014;Don't attack! We need to sneak in the dark!
1493;AH012BD;We'll give you some medicine later.
1892;AT302BC;Thank you so much, comrade!
1017;AM077AB;I can't believe this!
900;AE005_011;It's huge!
595;AM047BB;Roger!
1878;AEX04_523;Teleportation ships flying in!
2130;AE119_057;The air raid is starting, stay away!
2675;AA032ZA;Stay close to the enemy. Don't let them get away.
1070;AY014DD;I recovered!
1063;AF009DA;Haven't been seen yet.
1234;AC027DB;Party time!
1884;AM157BD;Let's talk about it next time!
1349;AE137_009;Attack the enemy camp!
1123;AO029BB;Change the cartridge!
2176;AE194_016;Infantry, use Barka as cover.
351;AB002DC;Heh!
2939;AN028BB;You to be our captain?
1483;AM147BA;You watch too much TV.
1440;AI003CB;Wings confirmed damaged!
825;AE002Z;DIE!
1134;AD001ZA;Ready to take off!
1747;AE141_018;WE'RE TAKING HEAVY DAMAGE!
1354;AM049X;I thought that was the case!
2289;AA039DB;If you want to fly faster, lose some weight.
1874;AR010BD;He was a great captain!
1121;AM042Y;Somebody said that too.
1037;AT104AB;I can't move at all!
1337;AC023DD;It will begin soon.
2133;AT304CA;Did you destroy the web? Thanks.
1378;AA072BC;How is this happening?
896;AM017BB;We did it!
3284;AE150_015;I'm sorry. We failed the Operation Arcalus.
1419;AEX04_059;All targets eliminated.
1014;AE009CB;Finish them!
3442;AE174_021;There's a really tall one! Its head is too high, it's out of range!
818;AM118DA;Let's do it!
2069;AE154_007;Huh, let's start with the aliens.
1082;AY030DA;That was close.
2724;AE103_041;I want to know where the pilot is coming from!
2293;AE140_026;We will show no mercy to our prey.
1483;AM087DB;You sure your eyes are OK?
519;AE006DA;Attack!
982;AM109BA;Don't be stupid.
1225;AE145_024;Advance one block!
3641;AE001_029;Watch out for the tanks! This is a vehicle-only lane. Don't get hit!
1843;AF004BE;It looks like the enemy can't see us.
1357;AY035DD;So sad.
3806;AE131_067;We can't let the monsters live. We must exterminate them all.
3195;AA105BC;I'd done the training for a guard, but not for a soldier.
1381;AE165_004;THEY COME ROLLING AT US!
1439;AEX04_399;A red one is in the mix!
498;AQ003FB;OH!
1418;AE128_020;Shoot them once they get close!
900;AM002Z;You'll be fine!
1188;AM148DA;I want to be an idol.
2231;AL003ZA;E-D-F! E-D-F!
2753;AE150_025;This area is right on Arcalis' projected path!
721;AY034BA;Heh.
1129;AE107_044;You'll receive a pension.
6648;AU152CA;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
781;AP023BA;We did it!
1433;AC015DA;Activate the shock absorber!
1268;AD013BB;It's too far to shoot!
1606;AEX04_703;Heavy tanks have arrived.
838;AC001BA;Ready for battle!
1607;AE114_009;Incoming monsters!
2738;AA061BB;It's too dangerous. Do you still want to fight?
1297;AA005DC;I'll fly higher next time.
1293;AT202BB;Someone is caught in the web!
784;AE144_024;What the hell?
4442;AE180_015;The Barga is made out of E1 alloy. Enemy attack won't pose a threat.
1070;AK001AB;There's the reinforcement!
1173;AT303CA;I barely escaped!
2218;AT305BA;I'm free. It's all thanks to you.
2459;AE127_011;There's an alien leading the monsters.
12058;AE110_043;Attention everyone, this is the chief commander. About ten days ago, we found that countless unidentified flying objects had appeared in the Earth's orbit without any warning.
1147;AF006AC;The enemy can't catch us.
1319;AH022BE;Our man is injured!
1386;AE005_022;Urgent, this is back up again!
1054;AI015DC;I think I'm done.
3197;AA011Z;Die defending your brothers. That's the mission.
938;AN024BB;Let's go together.
1817;AF008BA;Captain, request permission to fire!
1361;AM122BB;That's not true!
3358;AE119_052;Infantry units hide behind the tanks. Leave the enemy to us.
1695;AA029AB;This is a battle we cannot lose!
1786;AD013DC;Still outside the effective range.
1830;AE142_039;Their bodies are harder than steel!
1407;AE164_036;It got away.
1528;AE176_048;Nix 2, ready for combat!
1994;AE179_006;We don't have to worry about that at all.
3099;AE117_062;Were all those monsters born inside the cave?
1911;AA018X;I don't want to take a mission like this.
1854;AS003EB;Heh, heh, heh, AHHHHH!
3005;AE115_012;If we all attack the same alien together, we will win!
2048;AA027DD;Stabilizer Condition 1
1044;AM095DB;That's not true!
1972;AE119_009;Monsters are coming out from the sand!
368;AQ003AB;Buh!
1007;AA067DC;What's your purpose?
4693;AE114_053;They look just like humans. The resemblance is unbelievable.
1444;AE157_012;THEY KNOW OUR LOCATION!
1148;AR001AA;You killed my men!
2643;AE181_029;You handle Arcalus. We will take care of the rest.
2307;AA087DC;I might go crazy before I beat the enemy!
1429;AF005DC;Asking for permission to attack.
848;AM070BD;No way!
1515;AJ010DD;We don't have a commander!
1583;AE003X;RAWR!
1876;AN006DA;It's my job to protect civilians.
696;AP026BE;That's one.
1506;AE002BD;Whaaaaaa!!
768;AM065BB;That won't work.
695;AR002DA;Captain!
3203;AE201_005;They've taken over this area. We need to recover it.
2946;AI006X;You get a death gratuity if you die in action, right?
750;AM161BB;Thank you.
1683;AE197_030;I can't believe it.
3192;AZ005O;Satellite control to air raiders, waiting for attack request.
1766;AH024BE;Captain please hold on
1387;AL027BD;I took down the enemy!
2878;AE003_017;They killed my comrade! Time for revenge!
1737;AO006ZA;REACTIVATE THE WEAPON SYSTEM!
2401;AA050BB;I am more courageous than anyone else.
7559;AU111BC;Now we will invade the underground Wiping out the giant monsters, crush them one by one
2185;AF001Y;Thank goodness I'm short, they didn't see me.
1132;AE031AA;SHOOT AT THE FRONT!
1012;AL005X;Hooray!
1048;AI001Y;I'm badly injured.
925;AY013DC;I love you.
2055;AA024AC;Willpower is all that matters to a soldier.
1090;AE002_050;Go in for backup!
7484;AU031AB;High up in the air our comrades fight Dashing through the sky now like a million bolts of light
1730;AI003AC;Keep fighting, even if I don't make it!
717;AM108BB;That's not right.
1839;AL024DA;Landing, machine is normal.
2069;AO010Y;Where's the magazine? Ah, here it is.
1578;AA026CA;Stay pretty during battle!
1155;AE021AA;Take aim at the left!
934;AE015BB;How's that?
2116;AE198_028;Barga 5, my armor has taken a hit.
5252;AE191_009;That machinery is a miniature teleportation anchor. It teleports monsters to our world!
2732;AZ002H;Artillery to air raiders, ready for launch!
1330;AM104BC;That's what I heard!
2498;AL001AB;Bwahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
2812;AA025W;Thanks to them, all humans are united now.
1190;AZ012H;Loading! Hurry!
6251;AE004_050;This is Team Gamma! The enemy is trying to outmaneuver us! They're trained military soldiers!
967;AE210_118;Take a look at this!
1305;AA005ED;SOMEONE SAVE ME!
4369;AE205_008;We're surrounded by monsters! We don't need rescue anymore! Save the resources!
1048;AT205BC;I'LL DESTROY THE WEB!
1855;AE194_012;WHERE'S OUR REINFORCEMENT?!
1034;AO002BE;Reloading ammo
2129;AE184_014;Teleportation Anchor has been destroyed!
2873;AE123_030;So it's only us thinking that we're both humanoids.
1774;AA086BE;I don't hate dark and narrow places.
1794;AT004BA;I'm stuck in the web, save me!
2166;AE143_062;They aren't the master of the civilization.
1120;AF003CB;Not spotted yet.
1560;AA033CB;Stay focused while flying.
1359;AE149_019;Missiles incoming!
749;AM017BC;We did it!
1772;AN013DA;Hi Captain, nice to meet you.
2438;AF012BD;Sweet, the enemy is surprisingly careless.
3028;AE153_028;Too many aliens! We can hold no more!
4186;AA035ZA;Even if one man is down, the others must take down the enemy, you hear me?
964;AA080BD;You'll get lost.
1206;AE100_024;Were you even listening?
1396;AT108DD;I'm caught in the web!
6779;AE211_032;I will look for help. Is anyone alive? Is anyone hearing this? Anyone?
831;AL020BB;We did it!
619;AY028BD;That's funny.
811;AN004Y;I'll follow you!
870;AT005DB;I'm pulled in!
3144;AE140_021;Now we'll all be soggy, wet corpses. This is just great.
747;AY069BD;Don't worry.
2390;AE183_018;Winged aliens are entering combat area!
4592;AE130_037;Abort the attack on the enemy base. All units, focus on the enemies rather than the base.
903;AY047DA;I'll fight with you.
932;AA074BB;Where's the enemy?
10738;AE143_046;The Intelligence Division is very interested in you. We will start to watch and record your actions from now on. I will send one of my men to you who will surely become a great help.
1550;AE023W;I'll leave the front to you!
2151;AA013AC;EDF is human's hope. Remember that.
3573;AE156_017;When you're glued to the threads, just defeat Araneas and you can escape.
783;AE197_016;A big anchor.
1921;AE002W;HIIIIIIIIIIIII is so much fun!
1847;AEX04_711;Powered exoskeletons, charging in!
2713;AE142_030;There must be a bulk of monsters moving down there!
1218;AM068X;I'm okay with that!
959;AA111BB;Do you like the Army?
837;AY029DA;Hahaha
1611;AEX04_077;Air raid starting now.
948;AM098BE;THAT'S THE TRUTH!
1203;AEX04_175;Defend the square!
1252;AEX04_068;Successfully destroyed.
572;AE004DA;Fire!
606;AE104_048;Well done!
1122;AB008BA;Hey, let's run!
4513;AE105_064;Very well, the anti-material rifle should be able to shoot down those drones.
3803;AE112_046;If the Air Force can't get the job done, we'll have to do it ourselves.
6698;AU112V;Deep into the darkness, marching on We fear no danger, we stay strong
2045;AN028DA;It's a dream to fight together with a hero.
802;AA040DC;How's it going?
1107;AR014BB;One man down!
936;AE001BD;MWAH!
1189;AE030BD;Leave it to me!
3002;AE130_040;Leave the base alone! Destroy the aliens and drones!
1727;AD006BE;Attack them once they're in range!
2307;AE043AB;EDF always faces the enemy head on!
892;AM085BC;That makes sense.
1488;AE121_019;INCOMING DRONES!
880;AD001BC;The enemy's here!
1162;AQ011BA;The armor's damaged!
1138;AY040DB;At your service.
1041;AY032BB;I'm very sad.
1127;AE190_021;Take out the sniper!
1632;AR041BA;How dare you shoot my men!
2056;AE117_007;Let's move in and support the Vanguard!
1687;AT005BC;Damn those threads!
938;AD004BD;Ready to shoot!
895;AE202_048;So was my brother.
419;AE162_021;What?
1593;AC006BE;I can fight, you can trust me.
2700;AEX04_615;Sniper Team, hold the position and focus on your aim.
1097;AR036BB;Ken got chewed up!
829;AY073BA;Not a big deal.
1681;AE149_030;Damaged the robot successfully.
1281;AC017DC;Switch to burst mode!
1497;AE141_020;Destroy the cannons now!
1068;AH017BD;Keep your cool!
1300;AM059W;That's also possible.
2028;AEX04_608;This is Bluecoat. I'm in position.
1916;AE210_100;Someone has destroyed the cannons!
2530;AE195_008;There must be survivors! We need to find them!
916;AM171BB;I'm grateful!
5130;AE146_008;It's too dangerous to fight all the aliens at once. Take down one at a time.
688;AO001BA;LOADING!
616;AM051CA;Thank you.
1236;AM189BC;This is for money.
3290;AA040X;I have always wanted to be an explorer, now my dream has come true.
658;AY063BE;Forgive me.
1894;AJ014BB;Who is our superior officer?
588;AE128_014;They're coming!
1012;AY026BC;Ha ha!
802;AP002DC;One killed!
1268;AM013DB;Not bad!
1424;AM113BD;And you really think so?
2033;AO013BA;I'm changing the magazine! Support me!
688;AM039BB;Leave it to me.
619;AM081BC;That's right.
1880;AR009X;Hey! Why don't you move?
1118;AM067DC;It's common sense.
1884;AE136_015;Aim at the second mysterious monster!
2739;AA013BD;They must be surprised with Earthlings' recklessness.
3282;AA019DB;It's safe in the sky. There are monsters everywhere on the ground.
2612;AE105_067;Powered exoskeletons, initiate combat!
855;AM098DA;It's not!
702;AM018DD;Nice!
1318;AA061DB;Why would you become a pilot?
850;AM039DA;Sir, yes sir!
1242;AM148BE;IT'S POSSIBLE!
1315;AE210_105;Star One!
1121;AH004DB;I'll go help the injured!
2938;AZ004O;Satellite W1, ready to launch Bulge Laser.
2368;AF028BD;Since they didn't see us, should we retreat now?
1208;AE159_053;Attack the flying type!
762;AE043BD;Go for the right!
1151;AM099DC;That's not true!
1557;AD005CA;The enemy is outside the range!
1677;AO006DB;Weapon system, reactivate!
3011;AEX04_308;Looks like a new monster species. Stay on alert.
750;AM014BB;AMAZING!
1435;AL026BD;You did great too!
1255;AN016BC;I'll help you do the mission.
1281;AM096BB;YOU'RE NOT MISTAKEN!
3044;AE124_012;It will take time for the rescue teams to arrive. Hold your ground.
1798;AD009V;Attack them once they're in the range!
2205;AE116_029;It's those aliens with monsters!
1737;AN005ZA;Storm One. You can do it.
4605;AE153_046;X4, going down!
2713;AE211_076;The mother ships are indeed heading to this area.
691;AM010CB;Amazing
1241;AM093BC;This is obvious.
1608;AE145_028;MONSTERS!
1409;AE138_028;They're coming from the left and right!
1973;AE056BD;I've seen tons of movies like this!
3532;AE197_017;A big anchor dropped down. It will teleport more monsters any second.
1672;AP010BA;We did it! Direct hit!
3790;AE128_059;If this was a sci-fi movie, the aliens would be afraid of water.
7443;AU011CA;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry, we are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie.
1689;AE110_001;MONSTERS!
6000;AE166_040;The enemy's armor is too tough! We should focus our fire on one spot, and then attack their bodies from there!
1343;AB003BA;MOVE FORWARD!
2242;AE022Z;I dare you to send someone bigger!
542;AM154DB;Oh yeah?
672;AM023CB;Approved.
1216;AR023BC;Damn it, he died!
4751;AE001_052;The blast door came down when the alert system was triggered. Looks like we have to take a detour.
1162;AM096BE;YOU'RE NOT MISTAKEN!
1283;AJ005DA;WHERE'S THE REINFORCEMENT?!
1740;AA019BC;I can't possibly die.
1961;AL045BB;Boot camp is nothing like this!
2384;AT306DC;You are my hero. Thank you.
956;AC014AB;The enemy is nearby.
3141;AE141_023;Their number is not decreasing after getting attacked!
4346;AE104_040;I saw monsters! My friend was eaten! Please send someone over!
1300;AE008AA;FEED THEM BULLETS!
877;AY006BE;I'm in your debt!
1194;AR029BA;The boss got chewed up!
562;AY050BD;Goodbye.
671;AA040DA;How's it going?
3162;AE002_135;I'm sure there are tons of monsters on the other side of the door.
2930;AE004_025;They're coming! We'll be killed if we don't fight back!
1240;AR028BA;This big bro got chewed up!
1862;AL016V;All units, take a short break.
1625;AE141_074;Goddamn illegal aliens!
361;AE205_007;What?
1018;AE206_019;THIS IS GONE ONE
5649;AE210_135;This is wonderful, we did it! I can't believe we did it!
634;AH001X;Danger!
636;AP012DC;Great!
1989;AE150_006;Launch attack at the teleportation ships.
1781;AEX04_295;CONFIRMED, MOTHER MONSTER
1069;AM011ZA;Very impressive!
873;AH018BE;Are you attacked?
28142;AE102_002;This is a special news flash. There have been accounts of UFO sightings everywhere across the globe. And this time, the UFOs aren't just moving flashes of light caught on camera. According to eyewitnesses, they saw flying objects made of metal. For now, the identity of these objects remains unclear. Since there are reports of sightings coming from everywhere, it is speculated that there are multiple UFOs flying in different areas.
715;AL006BE;We did it!
1449;AM116BD;Don't say stupid things!
2849;AE170_030;Why don't you run? We've got no chance!
912;AY033DA;I'm disappointed.
1348;AP013DB;That one is killed!
684;AQ003V;DAH!
3015;AE128_003;Are you a sniper too? If not, go down there!
2299;AN004ZA;Spriggans will be on your side, don't worry.
4256;AE145_016;If we let him get close, the railguns will be vulnerable. This is the best way.
890;AF029BD;But they didn't see us.
727;AM073Y;Thanks for the help.
1810;AF013AA;Don't shoot yet. Let's keep approaching.
1321;AY007BC;I owe you a big one.
1754;AN002V;Civilian, I'll protect you.
2385;AE210_132;The command ship has been severely damaged!
935;AE002_101;What a nightmare!
1119;AG009BA;INCOMING!
344;AM153DA;Eh?
1354;AE117_013;What is this cave?
464;AY051BE;Later!
1593;AR005BE;Captain! Hold on!
2599;AA039DD;If you want to fly faster, lose some weight.
734;AK002Y;What's that?!
623;AY019BD;Hahaha
4256;AE210_120;This cannon emits high energy. This could be the shield generator.
516;AM071Y;Thank you.
1294;AH007DB;Check if there's any damage!
1986;AM093DC;Don't tell anyone.
349;AQ001Z;UGH
668;AE004DD;Fire!
2549;AE002_077;They're all gone. Or screwed.
2459;AM007AB;Pull the trigger! You can still manage this, right?
2943;AE193_006;It's a... TELEPORTATION DEVICE!
589;AM020AB;Great!
3020;AE183_002;We have to protect the citizens. Attach the winged alien!
2515;AE121_041;This is G2! We're being attacked by the cannons!
1528;AE201_007;Winged Alien detected!
684;AM080DB;No!
3168;AA119BD;I don't want my pension anymore, I want a discharge!
1961;AEX04_271;CONFIRMED, GREEN MUTANT
1315;AA004Z;Watch out for behind!
1499;AE131_003;Contact! Patrolls!
2134;AE179_035;Are you ready? Let's move on.
1378;AT007AA;Damn it! Let me go!
1037;AY069DC;No worries.
2004;AA069DD;We can barely fly underground!
1630;AN023AA;I'm surprised they made our ace here.
1440;AE055BD;Attacking the enemy now!
1780;AA068BE;Why did you take a mission like this?
1350;AEX04_032;Four aliens left.
1818;AO027BE;Reload! No need to cover me!
5106;AE210_065;If we let it escape now, we won't get another chance. We have to destroy it right now!
983;AA074BC;Where is the enemy?
4032;AE158_009;These barriers can even block artillery fire! Watch me destroy them!
1414;AE174_006;Next team, stand by!
1602;AE155_010;IT'S SHOOTING THREADS!
2362;AT303BB;You destroyed the web! I'm impressed!
1831;AZ027J;The attack is over, leave for now.
1013;AM032AA;I can't approve.
1891;AL008BC;All are blown away!
561;AB005AA;RUN!
1778;AR022BB;THIS THING KILLED MY BUDDY!
1990;AE161_004;Oh, how cute!
3272;AE186_032;This is Scout! Queens in sight! I repeat, QUEENS!
1116;AY076DA;We're partners, right?
2739;AF028BE;Since they didn't see us. Should we retreat now?
1543;AE112_049;There's a red light inside the hatch!
2435;AE153_032;Engage the enemies right here! Get ready!
997;AD004X;Wipe them out!
1619;AI021BC;It's just a scratch.
1755;AD016BE;Into the range! Come on!
6875;AU132CB;Please don't send us on these grave missions We're done with these expeditions
965;AT001AA;AHHH!
897;AD010CB;Attack later!
2109;AE145_035;Hey! Those are robots!
915;AM011AC;Just like that!
6689;AU152W;Why should I still keep on fighting on, shooting monsters dead from dusk till dawn?
4288;AE140_005;Sergeant, I finally got through. The Intelligence Division will support you.
2326;AA029BD;Believe in the headquarters and we will win.
3244;AE177_037;They might have called for reinforcements. We'd better get going.
1404;AR030BD;THE PRINCE GOT CHEWED UP!
1244;AE114_085;THERE ARE MORE IN THE AIR!
1569;AC025DA;Huh! Take this!
7491;AU011BE;Oh, we are the Valiant Infantry! We are the Alpha Team with passion and camaraderie!
2925;AL028DD;Of course! I'm blessed by the Goddess of Victory!
736;AJ011DB;Anyone!
1577;AA046AC;Let's find our enemies in the dark!
1399;AC023BC;Are we gonna fight?
1964;AV001Z;I'll destroy the web now and save you!
1406;AE167_007;Attack the big anchor!
3128;AZ029Q;This is Transport Chopper, dropping complete. Get on the vehicle.
1970;AS010BD;Bastard! Let go of me!
4231;AZ001H;Get away, kid! Hey, Air Raider, leave the bombing to me!
566;AQ003DD;AHHH
1058;AY064DB;I didn't mean to.
1169;AA043BD;Do you think we'll win?
1720;AN026BE;Without a commander, I'm troubled.
1684;AE145_077;HIDE INSIDE THE BUILDING! HURRY!
1106;AS001BA;AAARGHHHH!!
1636;AT110BA;Somebody destroy the web!
1759;AE177_040;Coming from above this time!
1326;AE001_033;HEEEEELP!
2293;AR007X;SOMEONE GOT KILLED! DAMN!
1058;AF029BC;They didn't see us.
558;AM047BE;ROGER!
2416;AT002BE;IS PULLING ME AWAY! SAVE ME!
3344;AE004_035;Do they have mouths too? Looks like they are talking!
7815;AU151CA;Abandoned by my friends and family Alone in the city surrounded by the enemy
6671;AU022BE;To defend our dearest Mother Earth, we're ready to give up our lives!
2084;AE198_020;Barga Six here, starting combat.
953;AN016DB;All yours.
2086;AE176_036;Aggressor species, gamma confirmed!
918;AF001CB;Go carefully.
577;AQ003EE;FUUUUU-
2305;AA075DD;So this is the underground wind.
973;AM122BA;That's not true!
2536;AL023DD;I'll take the opportunity to check my system now.
1305;AM152BA;OK! OK!
1229;AE159_008;Encountered flying type.
284;AM211BC;WHAT?!
2318;AT303BD;You destroyed the web? I'm impressed.
2833;AE002_121;If you don't fight, you will become their food.
1016;AM169BB;Thank you, sir.
1479;AK016BB;The job will never end.
3378;AF010CA;We are the Elite Unit. We should always keep calm.
600;AM041BD;Definitely!
2483;AF006CA;They haven't found us. Good opportunity.
1398;AE107_035;Did they try to ambush us?
1670;AO008AA;Cover me while I finish reloading!
3233;AE153_033;Adjust formation. Focus on the powered exoskeletons.
2207;AE005_055;I'll see you next time.
1728;AJ014BA;Who is our superior officer?
1721;AO023BC;Reloading is easy peasy!
6673;AE211_049;It's like magic. There must be a logical explanation behind this. But what?
4735;AZ026PB;That's me. I'm the one building this satellite. I am the so-called god.
3078;AE002_030;We're saved! What on earth happened?
1305;AM065W;That's also possible!
1586;AE132_007;I'll lead. Follow up!
959;AY046BE;Let's fight together!
3074;AE130_021;Enemy's incoming! Infantry units, support heavy tanks!
1896;AEX04_589;Shotgunners, commence operation.
1189;AE100_004;Go through this room.
1371;AT201BC;Oh no! Someone's caught!
576;AR008DB;BOSS!
820;AD003AA;Ready weapon!
3003;AE163_026;How can this be happening?
593;AM059DA;That's right!
1101;AO004DD;POWER CONTROL!
3487;AA135BE;We are supermen when we are empowered exoskeletons.
2095;AE158_036;Shieldbearer elimination confirmed!
4495;AE104_026;All available units, attack the monsters now. Wipe them out ASAP.
1097;AE204_020;Here they come!
2159;AM114BD;That's ABSOLUTELY wrong.
1220;AL011BE;E.D.F.!
1351;AE204_002;Retreat! Retreat!
442;AM060AA;Thank you.
2003;AI004CB;Sorry, I'm just useless.
809;AY027DB;You're funny.
740;AY073BB;Not a big deal.
1125;AY072DB;We'll think of something.
2176;AE140_020;I can hardly see. This is bad!
1515;AL037BD;That's enough.
1631;AE152_004;Wingdivers will arrive late!
